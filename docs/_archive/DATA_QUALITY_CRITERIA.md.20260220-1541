# Data Quality Index (DQI) Criteria

This MVP uses a weighted component score (0–100). Components are normalized to 0..1 and combined
with weights. Traceability is intentionally the highest weight.

## Components
- completeness: required PK set + CV/CI/n + study conditions
- traceability: fraction of numeric values with evidence excerpts
- plausibility: unit/range validation penalties
- consistency: conflict penalties across sources
- source_quality: species + source-type signals

## Weights
- traceability: 0.35
- completeness: 0.20
- plausibility: 0.20
- consistency: 0.15
- source_quality: 0.10

## Thresholds
- green: 80+
- yellow: 60–79
- red: <60
