# Open Questions Library

This library provides standard text snippets and triggers for unresolved items.

- HOSPITALIZATION_DURATION
  Question: Confirm hospitalization duration, sampling duration, and follow-up duration (how many t1/2 to cover).
  Trigger: Missing hospitalization_duration_days, sampling_duration_days, or follow_up_duration_days.

- PHONE_FOLLOW_UP
  Question: Is phone follow-up acceptable or recommended?
  Trigger: Missing phone_follow_up_ok.

- BLOOD_VOLUME
  Question: Confirm blood volume constraints (total vs PK-only).
  Trigger: Missing blood_volume_total_ml or blood_volume_pk_ml.

- DEC85_REQUIRED_PK
  Question: Provide missing PK parameters required by Decision 85.
  Trigger: Missing required PK outputs (Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, t1/2 or lambda_z).

- DQI_RED
  Question: Confirm sources / provide stronger BE/PK evidence.
  Trigger: Data quality level is red.

- CV_DERIVED_ASSUMPTIONS
  Question: Confirm assumptions for CV derived from CI (90% CI, 2x2 crossover, log-scale, correctness of n/CI).
  Trigger: CV source is derived from CI.

- CV_RANGE_UNCERTAIN
  Question: Provide measured CVintra if possible; risk-based N used.
  Trigger: CV source is range/uncertain.

- CV_CONFIRM_NDET
  Question: Confirm CV to enable N_det calculation.
  Trigger: CV not confirmed.

- CVFROMCI_POWERTOST
  Question: Install R/PowerTOST or provide CV manually.
  Trigger: PowerTOST unavailable for CVfromCI.

- FEEDING_CONDITION_CLARIFY
  Question: Source contains both FED and FASTED results. Choose protocol condition (FED or FASTED) before using PK/CI for calculations.
  Trigger: feeding_condition_conflict detected in extraction.

- FEEDING_CONDITION_TAGGING
  Question: Condition-specific tagging not available; manual confirmation required.
  Trigger: protocol condition selected but values are ambiguous without matching tags.
