## 2×2 Crossover
- **Sequences:** 2 (e.g. TR and RT). Each subject receives Test (T) and Reference (R) in different periods.
- **Periods:** 2 periods (one sequence per period).
- **Washout:** At least ~10 half-lives total (industry "10 half-lives rule":contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}) or until drug is essentially eliminated between periods. Typically ≥5 half-lives; ensure minimal carry-over.
- **Sampling:** Collect predose (time 0) and multiple post-dose samples. Dense sampling around expected Tmax and continue until ≥80–90% of drug eliminated (e.g. through 3–5 half-lives after dose) to accurately estimate AUC₀₋ₜ and Cmax:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

## Replicate Crossover (e.g. 2×2×4 Full Replicate)
- **Sequences:** 2 (e.g. TRTR and RTRT patterns).
- **Periods:** 4 (each subject receives each formulation twice).
- **Washout:** Similar rule: ensure at least 5–10 half-lives between each dosing period. Active and passive washout may be used.
- **Sampling:** Similar strategy each period (baseline + post-dose points around Tmax to tail). Additional reference periods allow estimation of intra-subject CV.

## Parallel Design
- **Groups:** 2 parallel groups (Test group, Reference group).
- **Periods:** 1 (single administration).
- **Washout:** Not applicable (each subject only dosed once).
- **Sampling:** Collect baseline and multiple samples post-dose for each group. Ensure sampling covers absorption and elimination phases (e.g. through ≥3–5 half-lives).
- **Note:** Larger sample size needed to account for inter-subject variability since subjects are not paired.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Sequences:** Always balance sequence assignment and randomize to avoid systematic biases (e.g. equal numbers on TR vs RT).
- **Sampling Considerations:** For any design, include enough timepoints to reliably estimate AUC and Cmax for each subject. Include trough (last point) at ≥3 half-lives post-dose to capture AUC₀–ₜ.
- **Washout Justification:** If half-life is very long, justify chosen washout (FDA/EMA guidance suggests ~5–10 half-lives to remove >99% of drug:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}).
