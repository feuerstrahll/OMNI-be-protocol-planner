baseline_design: "2x2 crossover"

drivers:
  high_intra_subject_variability:
    recommended_design: "Replicate crossover (e.g. 2×2×4 full replicate)"
    reason: "Highly variable drugs (within-subject CV > ~30%) benefit from replicate designs to reduce variability:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}."
  narrow_therapeutic_index:
    recommended_design: "Replicate crossover"
    reason: "Narrow therapeutic index drugs require scaled-average BE analysis, usually in a replicate design:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}."
  long_half_life:
    recommended_design: "Parallel (or extended washout in crossover)"
    reason: "Very long elimination half-life (t½ large) implies impractically long washout; a parallel design avoids carryover:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}."
  carryover_risk:
    recommended_design: "Parallel"
    reason: "Drugs with high carryover potential favor a parallel design (or replicate with long washout) to avoid period effects."
  multiple_formulations_or_conditions:
    recommended_design: "Parallel or extended sequence design"
    reason: "Testing multiple treatments or conditions (e.g. different formulations/fed states) may require additional arms best handled in parallel."
  ethical_steady_state:
    recommended_design: "Parallel"
    reason: "If patients must stay on therapy (no washout possible), use parallel design:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}."
