This study presents an investigation into several green spectrophotometric methods for the determination of amlodipine besylate and hydrochlorothiazide in both their pure binary mixtures and pharmaceutical formulations. A spectrophotometric method is proposed for the selective determination of amlodipine besylate in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide at 366 nm, where no interference from hydrochlorothiazide was observed. Additionally, a novel five different spectrophotometric approaches were applied for the determination of hydrochlorothiazide: the dual wavelength method, first derivative method, ratio difference method, and ratio derivative method, as well as Fourier Self-Deconvolution method. Amlodipine besylate’s linearity range was 5–30 µg/mL, whereas hydrochlorothiazide’s was 3–18 µg/mL reaching limits of detection of 1.238, 0.906, 0.825, 0.540, 0.779 and 0.805 µg/mL, respectively for all the proposed methods. The proposed methods were validated in accordance with ICH international guidelines, including full statistical analysis and comprehensive environmental evaluation using multiple assessment tools as The Analytical GREEnness Calculator, the Modified Green Analytic Procedure Index, spider diagram, and green analytical selection tool.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-33191-4.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>AGREE</kwd><kwd>Amlodipine</kwd><kwd>Hydrochlorothiazide</kwd><kwd>Spider diagram</kwd><kwd>MOGAPI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Chemistry</kwd><kwd>Environmental sciences</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Egyptian Russian University (ERU)</institution></funding-source></award-group><open-access><p>Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).</p></open-access></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Springer Nature Limited 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hypertension, also referred to as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by the persistent elevation of blood pressure in the arteries. High blood pressure typically does not present noticeable symptoms. However, it is a significant risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision impairment, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a leading cause of premature mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Many drugs have been suggested for treatment of hypertensive either in single medication or combination of more than one drug. Amlodipine besylate (AMB) (3-Ethyl 5-methyl (4RS)−2-[(2-aminoethoxy)methyl]−4-(2chlorophenyl)−6-methyl-l,4dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate benzenesulfonate.) is a calcium channel blocker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

The spectroscopic techniques employed for the quantification of the target drugs with other drugs are either overly complex or inadequate for their simultaneous determination in a binary mixture. Chromatographic techniques, in contrast, are less eco-friendly since they are time-consuming, expensive, and need higher amounts of organic solvents like acetonitrile and methanol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Numerous medicinal substances have been quantified and analyzed using UV spectroscopy. This method offers distinct advantages over separation-based techniques, including its simplicity and short analysis time. Additionally, it typically requires a low volume of analytical solvents, making it a cost-effective approach from an economic perspective and more environmentally friendly. Even though spectrum overlaps are often encountered when using this method for combination examination, post-acquisition mathematics calculations may help to overcome these problems. Among them are univariate procedures, such obtaining ratio spectra using divisors, followed by additional processing of signals approaches such as derivatives, ratio differences, and mean centering approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The aim of this study is to develop environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and time-efficient spectroscopic analytical methods named (zero crossing method for determination of AMB and dual wavelength (DW) first derivative (D<sup>1</sup>), ration difference (RD), first ratio derivative (RD<sup>1</sup>) and Fourier self-deconvoluting (FSD) methods for the determination of (HYD), whether in their binary mixtures in pure form or within their pharmaceutical formulation. These methods are intended to be suitable for application in quality control laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry. The use of environmentally friendly analytical methods is of great importance for the preservation of the ecological system. This principle was carefully considered in the design of the present study, particularly through the use of water as the sole solvent, rendering the method highly eco-friendly.

The scores for each subgroup ranged from − 5 to + 5. More information is provided by secondary spider diagrams for each of the five subcategories that were emphasized in Fig. S4. Data missing from solvent safety data sheets for any of the five subcategories described earlier were treated as having no value in the calculations, as there is often not enough information available for the aforementioned compounds.</p><p id="Par54">When looking for a sustainable green solvent, many industrial enterprises use the green solvent selection tool, a significant research instrument.

This method enabled the detection of any potential differences in group means with enhanced sensitivity. The visual representation in Fig. S6 illustrates the confidence intervals for each data group, with horizontal lines and central markers indicating the group means. The observed overlap between intervals further supports the conclusion that no statistically significant differences exist among the tested methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par65">One spectrophotometric method for determining AMB and five for determining HYD are available; they are sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive; and they are ideal for usage in labs that do not have access to the resources needed for chromatographic procedures. Moreover, these approaches have the benefit of being ecologically sustainable, unlike the described method that employs environmentally detrimental solvents like sodium hydroxide. The suggested methodologies were effectively used for the quantification of AMB and HYD in bulk powder, laboratory-prepared mixes, and pharmaceutical formulations. The ratio difference method is highly effective for determining HYD because of its low limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t-test, F-test, and ANOVA, and neither the reported method nor the proposed methods differed significantly from each other. In addition, the ANOVA findings were double-checked using Tukey’s HYD test.</p><p id="Par66">In the end, the suggested approaches were found to be very eco-friendly after an evaluation utilizing the AGREE, MOGAPI, spider chart, and green analytical selection tools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>

Recently, researchers have investigated the potential benefits of combining multiple medications in one bill to improve their metabolic and cardiovascular efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par2">We investigated a treatment approach that combines two antihypertensive medications with one statin. We aim to assess the safety and effectiveness of a triple therapy regimen consisting of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) combined with amlodipine/rosuvastatin. We compared this triple therapy to dual therapy involving either ARBs/amlodipine or ARBs/rosuvastatin in patients with HTN and dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">We conducted systematic search in the following databases: Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library until August 2024. The main outcomes assessed were the variations in mean systolic blood pressure (mSBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (mDBP), and the percentage changes in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) following an eight-week treatment period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Our analysis included seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which enrolled 1074 patients. Triple therapy revealed a significant reduction in mSBP (mean difference (MD): -4.06, 95% C.I. [-7.97: -0.15], p-value = 0.04), mDBP (MD: -5.45, 95% C.I. [-7.96: -2.93], p-value = &lt; 0.0001), and LDL-C (MD: -50.10, 95% C.I. [-55.55: -44.64], p-value = &lt; 0.001) compared to ARBs/amlodipine. Triple therapy significantly decreased mSBP (MD: −12.28, 95% C.I. [− 16.68: −7.88], p-value = &lt; 0.001) and mDBP levels (MD: −6.48, 95% C.I. [-10.95: -2.01], p-value = 0.005) compared with ARBs plus rosuvastatin. There was no significant difference in secondary outcomes, including total adverse events, cerebrovascular adverse events, and adverse drug reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par5">Triple therapy has greater effectiveness in decreasing blood pressure in hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia compared to treatments involving ARBs combined with amlodipine or ARBs with rosuvastatin. Additionally, Triple therapy significantly improved lipid profiles compared to the ARB/amlodipine group. Our study lays the groundwork for developing a single-pill, triple-combination therapy. Further RCTs are necessary to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s43044-026-00720-z.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Dyslipidemia</kwd><kwd>Triple therapy</kwd><kwd>Dual therapy</kwd><kwd>Meta-analysis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Egyptian Society of Cardiology 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par22">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is considered one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A significant percentage of patients diagnosed with hypertension (HTN) concurrently exhibit dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Piepoli et al. have highlighted a direct correlation between blood cholesterol and CVD, emphasizing the importance of reducing cholesterol to effectively lower CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As a result, recent HTN management has focused not only on lowering blood pressure but also on reducing overall CVD risk and this can be achieved by lifestyle modification and optimizing medication regimens to improve patient compliance and improve clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association published guidelines on hypertension treatment in adults which recommend combining two antihypertensive drugs from different classes for managing second-stage hypertension, defined as a blood pressure (BP) &gt; = 140/90 mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The guidelines recommend ARBs combined with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as a first-line treatment among the various available drug combinations.</p><p id="Par23">Rosuvastatin is an effective and safe option for treating dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, many patients continue to experience uncontrolled dyslipidemia, which further increases their cardiovascular risk. While previous meta-analyses have focused on comparing the efficacy of various pharmacological interventions for HTN, they have given limited attention to the coexistence of dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The optimal treatment strategy should tackle all these factors simultaneously, once-daily dosing and fixed-dose combination therapy can maintain good control of both BP and cholesterol levels.</p><p id="Par25">Hence, we perform this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of triple combination therapy with ARBs/amlodipine plus rosuvastatin compared with ARBs/amlodipine or ARBs/rosuvastatin in patients with HTN and dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Search strategy and data collection</title><p id="Par26">We systematically searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies up to August 2024 using the following search terms: (“Telmisartan” OR “Pritor” OR “BIBR” OR “Micardis” OR “Kinzalmono” OR “Semintra” OR “Tolura”) OR (“Amlodipine” OR “Amlodis” OR “Norvasc” OR “Istin” OR “Amlor”) OR (“Rosuvastati” OR “Crestor” OR “Ezallor”) AND (“Dyslipidemia” OR “Dyslipoproteinemia*” OR “Hyperlipidemia*” OR “Hypercholesterolemia*” OR “Hyperlipoproteinemia*” OR “Hypertriglyceridemia*” OR “Atherosclerosis”) AND (“Hypertension” OR “High Blood Pressure”) (Supplementary Table 1).

It included the process of randomization, concealment, deviations from intended interventions, use of appropriate analysis to assess the intervention, outcome measurement, selection of reported overall risk of bias and results. The methodological quality of the studies was categorized as either low risk, some concerns, or high risk of bias. Two independent authors assessed the risk of bias, and disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third author.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par32">We used RevMan v5.3 for statistical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Continuous outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (C.I.), while categorical outcomes were presented as risk ratios (R.R) with corresponding 95% C.I., which describe the ratio of the risk of an outcome event between the two groups. A fixed-effect model was applied for homogeneous outcomes; however, a random-effect model was utilized when significant heterogeneity was detected. I² and Chi-square tests were used to assess heterogeneity, where Chi-square determines the presence and degree of heterogeneity. I² values were interpreted according to the Cochrane Handbook (Chap. 9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as follows: 0–40% (not significant), 30–60% (moderate), 50–90% (substantial), and 75–100% (considerable). A significance level (α) below 0.1 in the Chi-square test was considered indicative of significant heterogeneity, as per the Cochrane Handbook (Part 2, Chap. 9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Heterogeneity in some outcomes was resolved using a random-effect model and conducting a sensitivity analysis. We excluded one study at a time and generated forest plots for the remaining studies to achieve the lowest possible heterogeneity. For dealing with missing data, when the standard deviation (SD) of change in outcomes was not provided, we calculated it from the standard error (SE) or 95% CI, as per Altman’s methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Publication bias</title><p id="Par33">A test for publication bias was not conducted, as tests for funnel plot asymmetry are recommended only for the outcome reported in at least ten studies, according to Cochrane guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><p id="Par34">We screened 1,016 articles through our search, with 947 remaining after removing duplicates.

In comparison, the cohort treated with ARBs/amlodipine had a mean age of 63.75 ± 9.91 years, a mean SBP of 150.70 ± 11.87 mmHg, and a mean LDL-C of 154.91 ± 31.20 mg/dL.

Four studies administered triple combination therapy in the form of three tablets, while two studies used two tablets—one combining ARBs/amlodipine and the other containing rosuvastatin.

Triple therapy significantly reduced mSBP and mDBP compared to both double therapy groups and was associated with notable improvements in LDL-C and HDL-C levels, particularly compared to the ARB/amlodipine group. Importantly, our study also assessed the safety of triple therapy versus double therapy, revealing promising results suggesting that both approaches are similarly safe. No significant differences were observed in TG levels across the comparisons, and triple therapy showed comparable lipid effects to ARBs plus rosuvastatin.</p><p id="Par60">The prevalence of HTN is rising alongside dyslipidemia, with up to 80% of patients experiencing both conditions simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Antihypertensive therapy can effectively reduce cardiovascular events—such as myocardial infarction, and heart failure—by 20% to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Clinical guidelines strongly recommend statins for lowering LDL-C in CVD prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, significant treatment gaps persist in clinical practice. Only half of hypertensive patients receive treatment, with just 34% achieving adequate blood pressure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similarly, statins and lipid-modifying agents remain underutilized in high-risk populations, contributing to preventable cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Compliance with statin therapy is also suboptimal, with 60% of patients ceasing treatment within the initial year and only 25% reaching their LDL-C targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Non-compliance with prescribed medications significantly contributes to these outcomes, leading to treatment failures and widening the disparity between clinical recommendations and actual results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The complexity of managing multiple medications often overwhelms patients, especially those dealing with several health conditions or older individuals, resulting in poor adherence rates.</p><p id="Par61">Previous studies have shown that statin therapy can lower blood pressure which might be attributed to its pleotropic effect or other mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For instance, a large meta-analysis involving around 50,000 patients from 46 clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found that statins, regardless of type or dosage, effectively reduce blood pressure, especially in younger individuals. These findings support the use of statins in combination with blood pressure medications, as seen in our study, where a statin was administered alongside two blood pressure medications. It’s worth noting that our study also assessed the safety of triple therapy versus double therapy, revealing promising results that suggest both approaches are similarly safe. However, a major drawback of triple therapy is its higher cost compared to monotherapy, along with potential challenges from drug interactions, which may complicate the interpretation of reported side effects.</p><p id="Par62">Considering the close association between HTN and dyslipidemia—both are major risk factors for CVD—earlier investigations have explored the efficacy of integrating antihypertensive agents with lipid-lowering medications, such as statins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A prior meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] encompassing six RCTs demonstrated favorable outcomes for a triple therapeutic regimen comprising ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, resulting in enhanced blood pressure regulation without compromising safety. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] underscored the critical role of triple antihypertensive treatment in individuals with high-risk hypertension. Consequently, we advocate for a novel therapeutic strategy that combines two antihypertensive drugs with a single statin. This approach is potentially beneficial for the proper treatment of both elevated blood pressure and dyslipidemia. While previous studies have investigated triple therapy, our analysis uniquely focuses on evaluating the efficacy of the combination of two antihypertensive medications alongside one statin.</p><p id="Par63">Although the included studies vary in the number of pills administered, our hypothesis suggests that reducing tablet quantity could significantly boost patient compliance with prescribed medications, potentially leading to improved cardiovascular metrics. As such, we emphasize additional RCTs that evaluate the efficacy of triple therapy, consolidated into one pill, compared to dual therapy in patients diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia. This approach aligns with the current trend of combining multiple classes of antihypertensive drugs into a single tablet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p id="Par64">Our study stands as the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the efficacy and safety of triple therapy combining ARBs, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, providing robust evidence on both blood pressure reduction and lipid profile improvement. All included studies were multicenter RCTs with no patient overlap; most were double-blind, except Kim et al. (2023), which was open label.</p><p id="Par65">However, several limitations should be noted. All studies were conducted in Korea, potentially limiting generalizability to other populations. There was variability in drug dosages and formulations across trials, and sample sizes were relatively small. Additionally, patient adherence and compliance were not reported, which may affect real-world applicability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par66">Our meta-analysis highlights that triple combination therapy with ARBs/amlodipine and rosuvastatin significantly lowers blood pressure, improves lipid profiles, and is similarly safe compared to double therapy in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Future studies should focus on developing a single-pill triple-combination therapy and evaluating its impact on adherence and clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</p><p>

In the 2021 annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, calcium channel blockers ranked 6th in the top 25 of fatal drug exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Unfortunately, there is no antidote available, making treatment challenging. Among the various treatment regimens, there are no practice guidelines based on randomized controlled trials. Recently, a systemic review of existing case reports was published, assessing treatment methods in regard to hemodynamic parameters and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is the second of two existing systemic reviews, the first one dating back to 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">We report two cases of severe amlodipine poisoning. Both patients ingested over 1000 mg of amlodipine. In the systemic review by Baid <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 18 case reports were included, most of which ingested 500 mg of amlodipine or less. The outcomes in patients with higher overdoses were mixed (600 mg of amlodipine: patient was discharged from the intensive care unit [ICU], 800 mg of amlodipine: patient expired, 840 mg of nimedipine: patient sustained hypoxic brain injury); none had been reported with an overdose of over 1000 mg of amlodipine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indeed, the German poison control center has deemed this dose lethal.</p><p id="Par22">Therefore, we want to report on our two cases regarding this high overdose and the new therapy recommendations published.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case presentation</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient 1</title><p id="Par23">We describe the case of a male, white, 70-year-old patient who ingested 1000 mg of amlodipine in a suicide attempt, with no prior psychiatric history.</p><p id="Par24">He was referred to us for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) evaluation after an external hospital managed him with over 3 µg/kg/minute of noradrenaline to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg (maximum daily vasopressor values are listed within Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Treatment included intravenous normal saline, calcium gluconate, high-insulin euglycemia therapy, as well as 20% intravenous intralipid emulsion, as recommended by the poison control center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite these measures, the patient’s condition did not improve, and he was transferred to our ICU. Upon arrival, his vasopressor requirement decreased to 2 µg/kg/minute of noradrenaline, allowing transport without veno-arterial (VA)-ECMO.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timelines for patients 1 (<bold>A</bold>) and 2 (<bold>B</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO1" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="13256_2025_5781_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">In our ICU, the patient was awake (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 15) and breathed spontaneously. We administered glucagon, starting with a 10 mg bolus followed by a 5 mg bolus to a total of 15 mg, as well as methylene blue. The patient’s hemodynamic status did not improve. We then started albumin dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With this we faced some interesting technical issues. Even though we used a high-flux filter with a sieving coefficient of over 0.9 for triglycerides and LDL, a secondary membrane was formed by the intralipid emulsion that had been administered not hours prior. This caused a high transmembrane pressure and almost instantaneous filter clotting. Despite these difficulties, we were able to exchange 3 L of plasma. However, if a patient is already dependent on continuous hemodialysis, the use of an intralipid emulsion may be disadvantageous.</p><p id="Par26">Unfortunately, the initial albumin dialysis had no noticeable positive impact on the overall situation; vasopressor demand remained high at approximately 2 µg/kg/minute noradrenaline. Furthermore, the patient began to develop combined respiratory-metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and encephalopathy requiring intubation and initiation of VA-ECMO. Under ECMO treatment the vasopressor demand declined significantly. Three days later, we performed another plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma because of chronic liver failure. From then on, we were able to see a rapid decline in amlodipine blood levels, falling from above 140 ng/ml to 40 ng/ml (for reference, blood levels of 15 ng/ml are therapeutic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The ECMO was explanted after 8 days. Finally, the patient was discharged from the ICU and transferred back to the referring hospital with no lasting organ damage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient 2</title><p id="Par27">The second case is that of a male, white, 28-year-old patient who ingested 1290 mg of amlodipine in a suicide attempt. He had a brief medical history of depression with suicidal thoughts, but so far, no suicide attempts.</p><p id="Par28">At the referring hospital, he received activated charcoal and high-insulin euglycemia therapy but developed pulmonary dysfunction requiring intubation. He experienced progressive vasoplegia. His condition worsened, prompting an evaluation by our ECMO team.</p><p id="Par29">At that point, the patient was in refractory vasoplegic shock. A maximal dosage of 6.6 µg/kg/minute noradrenaline, 4U/hour vasopressin, and 0.16 µg/kg/minute adrenaline were needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg (maximum daily vasopressor values are listed within Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). A peripheral VA-ECMO was established onsite. We chose not to use lipid rescue owing to complications witnessed in Patient 1 and began albumin dialysis upon ICU admission.</p><p id="Par30">Methylene blue was administered but showed little result. We decided to extend the regimen to angiotensin II acetate, reducing the noradrenaline dosage to around 2 µg/kg/minute. Glucagon was administered, starting with a bolus of 7 mg, followed by 7 mg/hour, the administration was stopped after only 1 hour owing to availability. In a recent case report, good results were achieved by off-label use of hydroxycobalamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the basis of that we also administered hydroxycobalamin, which showed good results. The vasopressor dosages decreased to 0.25 µg/kg/minute noradrenaline.</p><p id="Par31">However, hydroxycobalamin caused chromaturia. This discoloration did not only occur in urine, but also in the dialysis filtrate, which triggered machine safety protocols, causing it to stop treatment. The safety protocols had judged the red discoloration to be hemolysis and we were unable to circumvent this and restart dialysis. The discoloration lasted approximately 72 hours. Fortunately, Patient 2 was not solely dependent on continuous dialysis, and the break did not cause any complications.</p><p id="Par32">By day 3, the hemodynamic condition improved, allowing explantation of the arterial ECMO cannula. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and remained on veno-venous (VV)-ECMO for another 10 days. The patient recovered without lasting organ damage and was transferred to our psychiatric ward with good neurological outcome for further treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="Par33">Severe amlodipine poisoning causes prolonged vasoplegic shock. This can be managed using proper treatment and quick action until plasma levels decrease. Several treatment options exist for amlodipine poisoning, including well-established ones, such as high-insulin euglycemia therapy, and less common ones, such as albumin dialysis, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin.</p><p id="Par34">High-insulin euglycemia therapy is the standard and improves survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Glucagon is also a long standing recommendation but was limited in availability in our case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, it had little effect on hemodynamic parameters, as opposed to cases where glucagon could be administered for longer periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since amlodipine intoxications are on the rise, we advise evaluating the availability at your center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Albumin dialysis was first described for calcium channel blocker removal in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other than conventional hemodialysis, it can help reduce the blood levels of albumin-bound amlodipine. Consequently it improves survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the process is time consuming, as multiple dialyses, over the course of several days, are needed to remove amlodipine (depending on the initial amount ingested) from the blood stream. Hence, it is a supportive therapy with only indirect causal effects.</p><p id="Par37">Intralipid emulsion can be used to improve hemodynamic parameters in a wide range of substance exposures, among them, calcium channel blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Even though it is associated with better survival and positive effects on hemodynamics, in Patient 2 we deliberately decided against administering it to not compromise albumin dialysis or the integrity of the ECMO membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There have been several reports in the past about hypertriglyceridemia causing clogging of dialysis filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This was also the case in Patient 1, where triglyceride levels reached close to 7000 mg/dl following lipid rescue.</p><p id="Par38">Methylene blue, a nitric oxide scavenger, has some positive effects on hemodynamics, but lacks sufficient evidence for standard use and showed poor results in our case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We therefore cannot recommend it.</p><p id="Par39">Hydroxycobalamin as a counteracting agent for vasoplegic shock was first described in a patient post-thoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since then, several reviews have been published on its use in perioperative vasoplegia. However, the fact that hydroxycobalamin causes chromaturia, disrupting dialysis and plasma exchange has to be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For calcium channel blocker intoxication there has only been one case report so far, which reported a swift response and recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While we also witnessed a significant decrease in vasopressors, the time frame for administration should be chosen correctly.</p><p id="Par40">Lastly, extracorporeal life support is recommended as a last resort for vasoplegic shock and has shown to be associated with an improved survival, left ventricular function, and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Calcium antagonists are frequently used in suicide attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Limited data is available, potentially because most cases are fatal and remain undetected prior to the initiation of treatment. In cases of severe amlodipine poisoning prolonged vasoplegic shock is inevitable. In our case, the combination of treatments and ECMO led to the patients’ full recovery. On the basis of these recommendations we established our own institutional algorithm for treating amlodipine intoxication, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>In-house treatment algorithm for amlodipine intoxication</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="MO2" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="13256_2025_5781_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par42">As with all case reports or small case series, several limitations must be acknowledged:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par43">The presented data are derived from only two cases, which inherently limits the extent to which the findings can be extrapolated.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Given the use of multiple concomitant interventions (albumin dialysis, insulin/glucagon therapy, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin), it is not possible to attribute specific effects to any single treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">The proposed treatment algorithm reflects our institutional experience and should be interpreted as such; its generalizability to other settings has not been established.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ECMO</term><def><p id="Par4">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VV-ECMO</term><def><p id="Par5">Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA-ECMO</term><def><p id="Par6">Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRRT</term><def><p id="Par7">Continuous renal replacement therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p id="Par8">Mean arterial pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p id="Par9">Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCS</term><def><p id="Par10">Glasgow Coma Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>µg</term><def><p id="Par11">Microgram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>kg</term><def><p id="Par12">Kilogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>U</term><def><p id="Par13">Units</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ng</term><def><p id="Par14">Nanogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ml</term><def><p id="Par15">Milliliter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mg</term><def><p id="Par16">Milligram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>dl</term><def><p id="Par17">Deciliter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p id="Par18">Low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher’s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>YK: conceptualization (lead), investigation (equal), visualization (lead), writing—original draft (lead), and writing—review and editing (equal).

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are the standard treatment for common feline diseases, such as systemic hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, therapeutic strategies are limited due to the adverse effects of existing drugs like amlodipine, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. A critical lack of feline-specific data on the tissue distribution of VGCC subtypes fundamentally hinders the safe and effective application of CCBs in cats. This is because knowledge from other species is often not translatable due to the unique metabolic pathways in cats.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim:</title><p>To fill this critical data gap, the present study created the first baseline quantitative map of the mRNA expression of seven major VGCC α1-subunits across a comprehensive range of feline tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Twelve tissue types were collected from a single 16-month-old male cat. Using a validated TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time PCR assay, we measured the relative mRNA expression of seven CaV α1-subunit genes: <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1S</italic> (CaV1.1), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> (CaV1.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1D</italic> (CaV1.3), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1F</italic> (CaV1.4), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic> (CaV2.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1), and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> (CaV3.2).

The brain displayed prominent <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> expression. The mesenteric lymph node also showed significant <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1F</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> expression. Conversely, the liver and pancreas consistently displayed very low expression for most of the channel genes investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This study provides the first foundational mRNA expression map of major VGCC α1-subunits in feline tissues. The results reveal unique expression profiles that highlight both conserved physiological functions and significant differences compared to other species, particularly in cardiac and lymphoid tissues.

Therefore, understanding their specific expression patterns in different tissues is essential for predicting a drug’s therapeutic effects and potential side effects (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). VGCCs control the flow of calcium ions (Ca²<sup>+</sup>) into cells. This calcium signal is essential for many bodily functions, such as neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and gene expression (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) affect VGCC activity. Therefore, they are widely used to treat conditions of the heart, blood vessels, and nervous system (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Elliott and Ram, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The alpha-1 (α1) subunit mainly determines the function of a VGCC and forms the channel's pore. In mammals, researchers have identified ten different α1 subunit genes, which are grouped into three families: CaV1, CaV2, and CaV3 (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Dolphin 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The CaV1 family (L-type channels) includes CaV1.1, CaV1.2, CaV1.3, and CaV1.4. This family is the main target for many clinically important CCBs. The CaV2 family (P/Q-, N-, and R-type channels) is important for releasing neurotransmitters, whereas the CaV3 family (T-type channels) is involved in rhythmic firing and pacemaker activity (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In veterinary medicine, CCBs are a primary treatment for common and serious conditions, especially in cats. Systemic hypertension (high blood pressure) is a common problem in older cats, and it is often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The L-type CCB amlodipine (which mainly targets CaV1.2) is the standard first-line treatment (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Bijsmans <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Taylor <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The non-dihydropyridine CCB diltiazem is often used for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease in cats, because it helps relax the heart and improve blood flow (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Bright and Golden, 1991</xref>; Luis <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Fuentes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). The key roles of VGCCs in controlling neuron activity in the nervous system suggest that they are likely involved in feline seizure disorders (T-type channels) and pain pathways (N-type channels) (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Cooke and Snyder, 1998</xref>).</p><p>A wider variety of subtype-selective CCBs are available in human medicine, allowing for more specific treatment strategies for different diseases (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Hille, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). In contrast, the treatment options in feline medicine are more limited. Although amlodipine is used effectively for feline hypertension, its use can cause problems. For instance, amlodipine can activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in cats. This can be a problem for patients with hypertension and could worsen existing kidney or heart disease (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adin <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Garcia Marrero <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This is a significant concern and highlights a need for different or additional treatment strategies, such as targeting other VGCC subtypes or using CCBs with different effects.</p><p>However, safely introducing new or existing CCBs for cats is difficult because of a critical lack of information on VGCC expression in feline tissues. Most of what we know about CaV subtype distribution comes from human and rodent studies. This information cannot always be applied to cats because of the major differences in physiology and drug metabolism between species (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Court 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). For example, cats have unique metabolic pathways, like a lower ability for glucuronidation, which can change how a drug works in their body and increase the risk of side effects (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Court and Greenblatt, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Court, 2013</xref>). Without a detailed map of which CaV subtypes are expressed in target organs (e.g., blood vessels and heart) versus non-target organs (e.g., kidney and brain), we cannot accurately predict the effects of a drug on the whole body. Therefore, creating a baseline expression map of CaV genes is a necessary first step to understand channel-related diseases in cats, improve pharmacology, and develop safer and more effective treatments.</p><p>In selecting the target genes for this initial mapping study, we prioritized the VGCC α1-subunits with the highest established clinical and pharmacological relevance. The CaV1 (L-type) and CaV3 (T-type) families were included because they are the primary targets of widely used CCBs in veterinary medicine, such as amlodipine and diltiazem. We focused on <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic> (CaV2.2, N-type) from the CaV2 family because it is a well-validated drug target in human medicine. For instance, the selective N-type blocker ziconotide is used for severe chronic pain (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">Zamponi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), and L/N-type dual blockers like barnidipine are used for hypertension (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In contrast, while physiologically important, clinically approved selective therapeutic agents for CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) and CaV2.3 (R-type) are currently lacking in either human or veterinary medicine. Therefore, we determined that profiling the seven selected subunits would provide the most impactful initial dataset for advancing feline pharmacology.</p><p>This study aimed to fill this gap in feline-specific molecular data. Specifically, we measured the relative mRNA expression of seven CaV α1-subunit genes: <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1S</italic> (CaV1.1), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> (CaV1.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1D</italic> (CaV1.3), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1F</italic> (CaV1.4), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic> (CaV2.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1), and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> (CaV3.2). Using a validated TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay, we analyzed expression in 12 different tissues: the brain (cerebrum), heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, small intestine, colon, mesenteric lymph node, testis, and skeletal muscle. This analysis will provide new and important data for understanding the function of CaV channels in domestic cats. It will also be a useful resource for future physiology, pathology, and pharmacology studies in this species.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue sample collection and preparation</title><p>Twelve types of tissues were collected: For organs with functionally distinct subregions, samples were specifically taken from the brain (cerebrum), heart (ventricle), and small intestine (jejunum). The other tissues collected were the lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney, colon, mesenteric lymph node, testis, and skeletal muscle.

The qPCR was performed using the Probe qPCR Mix (TaKaRa, Cat. No. RR391) on a Thermal Cycler Dice Real-Time System III. The primers and probes for the target genes were custom-designed Custom TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Prior to the study, a preliminary experiment was conducted to determine the most suitable reference gene from four commonly used candidates (18S rRNA, GAPDH, β-actin, and β-tubulin). Based on this analysis, 18S rRNA was selected as it showed the most stable expression across the 12 feline tissue types. The stability of 18S rRNA was further confirmed in the main experiment, where its quantification cycle (Ct) values showed low variance across all tissues (mean Ct = 12.97 ± 0.74). Therefore, eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA (TaqMan Assay ID: Hs99999901_s1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 4331182) was used as the endogenous control for normalization. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds, followed by 40–50 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 5 seconds and annealing/extension at 60°C for 30 seconds. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Data and statistical analysis</title><p>Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> method, where ΔCt = (Ct target gene−Ct 18S rRNA).

For a comprehensive visualization of gene expression, the calculated 2<sup>−ΔCt</sup> values were used to generate a heatmap summarizing the expression patterns across all twelve tissues.

Our main goal was to provide baseline data for these key ion channels in cats, which is currently lacking. As mentioned in the Introduction, such a map is required to understand how CCBs work in cats. Cats have unique metabolisms; therefore, data from humans or dogs cannot always be directly applied (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Court, 2013</xref>). The different tissue-specific expression patterns we found provide a data-based starting point for future physiology, pathology, and pharmacology research. This allows us to move beyond guesswork, especially for issues such as the RAAS activation that can be caused by amlodipine (Jepson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; Ward <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024) .</p><p>Comparing our feline data with previous findings in humans and dogs reveals both similarities and significant differences, which have implications for feline medicine. In the cardiovascular system, the cat heart showed high mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> (CaV1.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> (CaV3.2), and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1). The high expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> is consistent with its established role in heart function in humans and dogs (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Herold <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). This helps explain why L-type CCBs, such as amlodipine and diltiazem, are effective in treating hypertension and HCM in cats. In humans, genetic problems with <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> can cause conditions including Timothy syndrome, and an age-related increase in cardiac <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> is linked to atrial fibrillation in dogs (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Gan <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This suggests that <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> is a good candidate for investigating feline heart diseases. In addition, the moderate <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> expression in the cat kidney might contribute to the unintended RAAS activation seen with amlodipine treatment in cats (Jepson <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic> 2014; <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Adin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; Ward <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2024). An interesting finding was the high co-expression of two T-type channels, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1) and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> (CaV3.2), in the cat heart. This is different from canine Purkinje fibers, where <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> is much more common (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">Hirano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). This balanced, high expression in cats suggests that both T-type channels could be vital for the electrical system of the heart and might be useful targets for treating arrhythmias, possibly requiring different drug strategies than in dogs. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1D</italic> (CaV1.3) expression was low in the whole cat heart. This is different from its crucial role in the pacemaker nodes of the human heart (<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Zaveri <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). This could mean that there is a major physiological difference in how the heart rhythm of the cat is generated. Alternatively, the signal from the small sinoatrial node might have been diluted in the whole-heart sample. Further studies using microdissected tissues are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Regarding the nervous system, the cat brain had high <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic> (CaV2.2) and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1) expression, along with noticeable levels of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1D</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic>. The very high expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1B</italic> (N-type) is consistent with its main role in releasing neurotransmitters and in pain signaling in other species (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Andrade <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), which supports the idea that it could be a target for pain relief in cats. The high expression of T-type channels (<italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic>) fits with their known roles in human epilepsy (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Iftinca, 2011</xref>) and supports the hypothesis that they may be involved in seizure problems in cats.</p><p>A notable finding in the immune system was the high mRNA expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic> (CaV1.2), <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1F</italic> (CaV1.4), and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> (CaV3.1) in feline lymph nodes. These channels are known to be essential for immune cell function in humans (McRory, <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004; <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Herold <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). This strong and varied CaV expression in cat lymphoid tissue, for which there is little data in dogs, suggests that these channels could be critical for regulating the immune system of cats. This raises the possibility that CCBs administered to the whole body could have significant effects on the immune system in cats. This idea should be investigated for feline inflammatory or immune-related diseases.</p><p>Another distinct pattern was observed in skeletal muscle, where the high expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1S</italic> (CaV1.1) almost exclusively matches its distribution and indispensable role in muscle contraction in humans (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Flucher, 2020</xref>). This similarity implies that cats could have muscle diseases similar to human CACNA1S-related problems, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Striessnig <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Such conditions may currently be overlooked in cats.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide a molecular foundation with several direct clinical implications for feline medicine. In cardiology, the high expression of CACNAIC (CaV1.2) alongside T-type channels (CaV3.1/3.2) in the heart not only supports the current use of CCBs for hypertension and HCM but also suggests that T-type channels could be novel therapeutic targets. In neurology, the highly specific expression of the N-type channel CACNAIB (CaV2.2) in the brain strongly suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for feline pain management, while the high expression of T-type channels reinforces their relevance to seizure disorders. Furthermore, the distinct CaV signature identified in lymphoid tissue points to the potential immunomodulatory effects of CCBs, while the conserved expression of CACNAIS (CaV1.1) in skeletal muscle suggests that feline channelopathies analogous to human disorders may currently be underdiagnosed. Thus, this expression map serves as a critical resource to guide the development of more selective and effective therapeutic interventions for cats.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the data were obtained from a single healthy animal; therefore, the findings should be considered as a pilot dataset. While this initial mapping effort provides a valuable foundation, future studies with an expanded sample size are essential to confirm these results and enhance their translational relevance. Second, we measured mRNA levels, which may not always correspond to the amount of functional protein due to complex post-transcriptional and translational regulation. Therefore, future studies to evaluate VGCC protein expression are essential to complement the present mRNA data and provide deeper insights into channel function. However, such studies in cats currently face significant technical hurdles, primarily the limited availability of validated, feline-specific antibodies necessary for reliable protein quantification. Third, whole tissues may have hidden expression patterns in specific cell types or small but pivotal sub-regions, such as the heart’s conduction system. Finally, our analysis only looked at seven α1-subunits and excluded other α1-subunits or the auxiliary subunits (β, α2δ, γ) that also affect channel function.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides the first baseline mRNA expression map of CaV channels in cat tissues. Our results show distinct expression profiles that point to both shared physiological roles with other species and notable differences, especially in heart and lymphoid tissues. This information is valuable for a better understanding of feline physiology, for more accurately predicting the effects and side effects of CCBs, and for guiding research into feline channelopathies. For next steps, it would be beneficial to confirm these findings at the protein level and study the functional properties of these channels in isolated cat cells. It is also imperative to investigate CaV expression in feline disease models (e.g., HCM, CKD, and epilepsy). Targeted studies are warranted to clarify the roles of the uniquely expressed channels identified here: the low cardiac <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1D</italic> in feline pacemaking, the high co-expression of <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1H</italic> in the electrical system of the heart, and the diverse CaV signature (<italic toggle="yes">CACNA1C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1F</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CACNA1G</italic>) in the feline immune system. Such work will help develop new diagnostic and treatment strategies specifically for cats.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Junya Kobayashi of the RIAS for his expert technical assistance with the quantitative PCR experiments.</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>T.M. was an employee of Toray Industries Inc. during the execution of this study.

The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing globally. Hypertension and dyslipidemia are well-established risk factors, and their co-existence significantly increases the risk of CVD. Epidemiological studies consistently report a high prevalence of their co-existence, ranging from 15% to 31%. The combined impact of hypertension and dyslipidemia on the vascular endothelium is more detrimental than their individual effects, potentially accelerating atherosclerosis and increasing the overall risk of CVD. This review highlights the benefits of concurrently treating dyslipidemia and hypertension to prevent CVD, drawing insights from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial study and recent clinical studies conducted in Asia. Notably, the single-pill combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin has been shown to enhance adherence while providing a synergistic effect in protecting the vascular endothelium and preventing CVD. By aggressively managing both conditions, healthcare providers can significantly reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events across diverse patient populations and ethnicities.

The present study aimed to explore molecular and histopathological factors potentially contributing to gingival changes in patients receiving amlodipine therapy, with a particular focus on molecules implicated in extracellular matrix turnover and tissue remodeling. <bold>Methods</bold>: The study included three groups of participants: patients with amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement, patients with gingival enlargement of inflammatory origin, and amlodipine-treated patients without gingival overgrowth. Gingival tissue samples were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining to assess inflammatory changes and general tissue architecture, and Picrosirius Red staining to visualize collagen fibers. Relative gene expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), IL-13, MMP-1, and procollagen was determined by real-time PCR, while collagen content was quantified using ImageJ software. <bold>Results</bold>: Histopathological evaluation revealed a less pronounced inflammatory response in amlodipine-related gingival enlargement compared to those who did not use amlodipine. The highest expression of α-SMA was detected in patients who did not receive amlodipine, whereas IL-13 and procollagen expression were markedly elevated in the amlodipine-induced group compared to others. MMP-1 expression was significantly lower in amlodipine-treated patients relative to those who did not use amlodipine, suggesting impaired collagen degradation. These findings, together with our previous results indicating enhanced expression of profibrotic mediators, suggest that altered extracellular matrix metabolism is potentially dominant in this condition. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement appears to involve a multifactorial process characterized by a prominent fibrotic component, reduced matrix degradation, and secondary inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>amlodipine</kwd><kwd>gingival enlargement</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>IL-13</kwd><kwd>α-SMA</kwd><kwd>MMP-1</kwd><kwd>procollagen</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>histopathology</kwd><kwd>real-time PCR</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Serbia</funding-source><award-id>01-773/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>the Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia</funding-source><award-id>451-03-137/2025-03/200111</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Internal Project No. 15/21 of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Serbia (01-773/1, 21 January 2022) and by the Ministry of Science, Technological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia (Contract no. 451-03-137/2025-03/200111).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pharmaceuticals-19-00045"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Drug-induced gingival enlargement is a recognized and widespread adverse effect, most commonly associated with the use of phenytoin, cyclosporine, and nifedipine, a first-generation calcium channel blocker (CCB) [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, amlodipine, a third-generation CCB, has also been increasingly reported to cause this adverse reaction, although fewer scientific data are available regarding its underlying mechanisms and clinical use [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Drug-induced gingival enlargement is characterized by an increase in gingival volume, typically affecting the papillary or marginal tissues. It is more frequently observed in the anterior than in the posterior region, and on the buccal rather than lingual or palatal surfaces. Depending on its severity, this condition may compromise aesthetics and function, while also favoring bacterial biofilm accumulation, which contributes to periodontal pathology [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent histological investigations have demonstrated that enlarged gingival tissue differs from healthy gingiva, most notably by increased fibrosis and elongated rete pegs. The histological characteristics of drug-induced gingival enlargement (DIGE) also include thickening of the epithelium, increased numbers of fibroblasts and blood vessels in the connective tissue matrix, and accumulation of ground substance. Variations in the degree of fibrosis have also been reported among drug-induced cases, based on semiquantitative histological assessments. More recent findings indicate disruption of the basal membrane, characterized by discontinuous collagen type IV and decreased laminin 5 expression [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of CCBs-induced gingival enlargement is not fully understood. However, CCBs can disrupt fibroblast calcium metabolism, impairing collagenase activity and leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Gingival tissue undergoes continuous cycles of injury and repair, regulated mainly by cytokines and chemokines. Among these, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) promotes fibroblast recruitment and ECM protein synthesis, while connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) acts downstream of TGF-β1, amplifying fibrotic responses [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. TGF-β1 is also a key inducer of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process in which epithelial cells migrate into the connective tissue and acquire fibroblast-like characteristics. During pathological EMT, myofibroblasts emerge and are characterized by de novo expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), which is widely used as a molecular marker associated with fibrosis [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to TGF-β1, other cytokines have been implicated in the regulation of fibrotic processes. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been identified as a profibrotic cytokine involved in several fibroproliferative disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, myocardial and renal fibrosis, and pathological scarring [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Its activity promotes collagen synthesis and accumulation by fibroblasts, and recent evidence indicates that combined inhibition of IL-13 and TGF-β signaling more effectively suppresses fibrotic pathways than TGF-β inhibition alone [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In parallel, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), a key enzyme responsible for collagen degradation and extracellular matrix remodeling, has been shown to play an opposing yet complementary role. Reduced MMP-1 expression, reported in DIGE, particularly in patients treated with cyclosporine, contributes to impaired collagen turnover and excessive connective tissue deposition. Conversely, increased MMP-1 activity observed in inflammatory periodontal disease suggests that the imbalance between matrix synthesis and degradation may be a crucial determinant of gingival fibrosis [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>This study aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement through an integrated histopathological and molecular analysis. We assessed fibrosis, collagen deposition, as well as the relative gene expressions of α-SMA, IL-13, MMP-1, and procollagen, to better define their roles in gingival tissue remodeling and fibrogenic activity. In contrast to our previous investigation conducted in the same patient cohort [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which focused primarily on oxidative stress and cytokine- and growth factor-related alterations, the present study addressed structural and matrix-related changes in gingival tissue. By combining histological assessment with the analysis of relative gene expression of selected molecular markers linked to extracellular matrix turnover and fibroblast-related pathways, this study provided complementary and incremental information on the tissue-level features of amlodipine-induced gingival overgrowth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-19-00045"><title>2.

In patients receiving amlodipine therapy who exhibited pronounced gingival enlargement, focal accumulations of mononuclear inflammatory cells were observed within the gingival connective tissue. In contrast, gingival tissue from patients with gingival enlargement unrelated to amlodipine use contained a large number of inflammatory cells, organized either in focal clusters or diffusely distributed mononuclear infiltrates (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-19-00045-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Pathohistological score in gingival tissue was significantly higher in groups with gingival enlargement (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-19-00045-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D).

Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to investigate the fibrotic component of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement and used histopathological scores to determine the presence of an inflammatory component and to assess the architecture of gingival connective tissue in patients with amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement. The study included three groups: (1) patients with amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement, (2) patients with gingival changes in inflammatory origin who do not take amlodipine, and (3) a negative control group consisting of patients on chronic amlodipine therapy who do not exhibit gingival enlargement. This design aimed to identify significant differences among groups, thereby exploring potential mechanisms associated with the occurrence and pathogenesis of this condition, which is still not sufficiently elucidated.</p><p>Based on histopathological scoring, inflammation was significantly more pronounced in patients without gingival enlargement than in both amlodipine groups, regardless of whether gingival overgrowth was present. These findings are consistent with our previous research on this topic, suggesting that while inflammation may be involved in the overall tissue response, it may not represent the dominant driving factor in the development of amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, earlier studies on human samples reported no significant difference in the histopathological inflammation scores between patients with gingival enlargement of inflammatory origin and those with amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although our findings differ in that respect, it should be emphasized that our study also included patients treated with amlodipine who did not develop gingival enlargement. Given that no significant difference in inflammation was observed between these two amlodipine-treated groups, the overall results support an association between gingival enlargement and mechanisms beyond inflammation alone, rather than indicating a primary inflammatory etiology.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that a fibrotic component likely exists in drug-induced gingival enlargement, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Fibroblasts are thought to play a central role, given their function in producing and degrading ECM proteins. Fibroblasts from phenytoin-induced gingival enlargement reportedly show higher proliferation and collagen synthesis than those from healthy gingiva, suggesting a possible selective pressure favoring a more fibrogenic subpopulation. Previous ultrastructural studies indicated the presence of myofibroblast-like cells. Myofibroblasts, typically characterized by α-SMA expression, have been proposed as contributors to ECM deposition during tissue remodeling. Under normal conditions, such as wound healing, these cells usually undergo apoptosis once repair is complete. When this process fails, their persistence may promote excessive ECM accumulation and potentially lead to pathological fibrosis [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the present study, α-SMA was assessed at the relative gene expression level. The highest α-SMA gene expression was observed in the second group (patients with inflammatory gingival enlargement). However, a significant difference was also noted between patients who developed gingival enlargement and those who did not, suggesting differential regulation of ACTA2 transcription rather than providing direct evidence of increased myofibroblast abundance. This may be explained by acute tissue damage and a more intense defense response. In contrast, amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement likely lacks such acute injury. Moreover, recent studies have indicated a potential link between periodontitis and EMT, which could help explain why α-SMA gene expression was the highest in the group with inflammatory gingival enlargement [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Procollagen gene expression levels were notably higher in patients with gingival enlargement compared to those without this adverse effect. This observation is consistent with the concept that procollagen expression may reflect ongoing fibrotic activity, as this molecule has been proposed as a potential biomarker of fibrosis [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], suggesting that procollagen gene expression is more likely to be elevated in patients with existing gingival enlargement.</p><p>Evidence from previous studies suggests that IL-13 may contribute to abnormal fibroproliferative activity. Interestingly, a recent report demonstrated that in fibrotic conditions, simultaneous inhibition of both IL-13 and TGF-β1 signaling completely attenuated the fibrotic mechanism compared with inhibition of TGF-β1 alone. Functionally, the IL-13 signaling pathway may activate fibroblasts to produce extracellular matrix components and other related factors necessary for collagen fibrogenesis. IL-13 has also been reported to induce TGF-β1 expression, acting primarily on fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which results in increased collagen and matrix synthesis [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our study, higher levels of IL-13 gene expression were observed in the group of patients with amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement compared to those without this adverse effect. These analyses were conducted on the same tissue samples from the previously studied patient cohort, in which elevated TGF-β1 relative gene expression was also observed in our previous research [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The concordance between IL-13 relative gene expression and our earlier findings may point toward a potential association between these pathways in the fibrotic component of gingival enlargement [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, differences in molecular pathways between drug-induced and inflammatory gingival fibroses have been reported, suggesting that cytokines such as IL-13 may be regulated in a context-dependent manner [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the observed increase in IL-13 relative gene expression levels should be interpreted within this heterogeneous context. Our results may indicate that the fibrotic component of gingival enlargement may involve a network comprising IL-13 and previously identified pathways for TGF-β1, CTGF, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been reported to potentially enhance TGF-β1 activation, suggesting that synergistic interactions among these mechanisms may have occurred [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, prior studies have shown that increased oxidative stress enhances TGF-β1 activation [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], supporting the hypothesis that these pathways may act synergistically. Collectively, the current and our previous findings support the possibility that IL-13, in conjunction with TGF-β1/CTGF signaling and oxidative stress, may be involved in the molecular framework underlying amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement. While further research is necessary to clarify these interactions, targeting IL-13 signaling along with TGF-β1 and oxidative stress pathways may offer a promising strategy for the prevention and management of this condition.</p><p>MMP-1 plays a crucial role in initiating extracellular matrix degradation and, with other matrix MMPs, facilitates the breakdown of collagen. Previous studies have reported a significant reduction in MMP-1 expression in overgrown gingival tissues of organ transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine A. Further investigations suggest that cyclosporine A suppresses both the synthesis and enzymatic activity of MMP-1 in gingival fibroblasts, which may contribute to gingival enlargement. Conversely, increased levels of MMP-1 mRNA have been identified in gingival tissues from patients with periodontitis, indicating a distinct regulatory mechanism in inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, even though amlodipine likely does not share the same mechanism of gingival enlargement as cyclosporine, the results are consistent with previous research on drug-induced gingival overgrowth associated with this medication [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Patients treated with amlodipine, regardless of whether they developed gingival enlargement, exhibited significantly lower MMP-1 gene expression levels compared to those with gingival overgrowth of inflammatory etiology. This contrast further supports the notion that drug-induced and inflammatory gingival enlargement may involve partially divergent molecular pathways. Furthermore, previous findings suggest that amlodipine, unlike nifedipine, may directly suppress MMP-1 expression in IL-1β-stimulated endothelial cells, thereby reducing collagenolytic activity [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results are in line with the possibility that a similar mechanism may operate in gingival tissue, where amlodipine could contribute to decreased MMP-1 expression and subsequent extracellular matrix accumulation. Previous studies indicated that gingival enlargement associated with CCBs is mediated by distinct molecular mechanisms depending on the specific agent [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nifedipine is reported to induce gingival overgrowth more frequently than amlodipine, a difference attributed to variations in pharmacokinetic properties, tissue distribution, and the cellular responses of gingival fibroblasts. In contrast, diltiazem is less consistently associated with gingival enlargement, with available data suggesting weaker or more variable effects on gingival fibroblast behavior compared to dihydropyridine CCBs [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The reduced MMP-1 relative gene expression observed in amlodipine-treated patients in the present study may therefore reflect a drug-specific modulation of matrix degradation pathways. These findings further support the concept that calcium channel blocker-associated gingival enlargement is a potentially heterogeneous condition with agent-dependent molecular characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-pharmaceuticals-19-00045"><title>4.

Group two consisted of patients with gingival enlargement of inflammatory origin who had never received amlodipine (A−GE+).

Patients classified with gingival enlargement of inflammatory origin were systemically healthy and were not receiving amlodipine or any other medication associated with drug-induced gingival enlargement. This group comprised individuals exhibiting clinically evident gingival enlargement with pronounced signs of gingival inflammation, as determined through clinical examination. Diagnosis relied on established clinical criteria, including alterations in gingival color, contour, and volume, as well as the presence of bleeding on probing, increased plaque accumulation, and calculus deposits. Absence of systemic disease or pharmacological exposure linked to gingival overgrowth was confirmed, supporting the classification of gingival enlargement as primarily inflammatory.</p><p>After informed consent, all participants underwent a comprehensive dental examination by the principal investigator to assess gingival enlargement and overall oral health. Periodontal status and oral hygiene were quantified using validated indices, including the Silness–Löe Plaque Index, Papilla Bleeding Index, and clinical attachment level.

Histopathological Analysis</title><p>For the histopathological assessment, samples of gingival tissue were immersed in a 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution and subsequently embedded in paraffin, forming formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks.

These sections were then stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for ten minutes, followed by a two-minute staining with eosin. Afterward, they underwent dehydration, clearing with xylene, and were mounted with DPX medium. To evaluate collagen content and its structural arrangement, additional sections were stained with Picrosirius Red solution, which contained 0.5 g of Direct Red 80 in 500 milliliters of saturated picric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), for one hour.

Fields lacking gingival tissue were excluded from further evaluation.</p><p>The pathohistological features of the samples were assessed based on several parameters, which were expressed as a cumulative score: epithelial thickness (0—normal; 1—moderate hyperplasia; 2—pronounced hyperplasia), rete ridge configuration (0—normal, 1—bulbous, 2—thin and narrow), presence of inflammation (0—absent, 1—mild, 2—moderate), and hyalinization (0—absent, 1—mild, 2—pronounced). Additionally, the inflammatory aspect was examined using the inflammation scoring system for gingival enlargement caused by amlodipine, as proposed by Siddika Selva Sume et al. [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This scoring system evaluated the presence and severity of inflammation in the gingival tissue and was classified as follows: 0—no signs of inflammation; 1—mild inflammation; 2—moderate inflammation; 3—severe inflammation. Histological evaluations, pathohistological scoring, and inflammatory scoring were conducted in a blinded manner by two independent observers. The agreement between raters was significant (Cohen’s kappa = 0.704 ± 0.057, 0.716 ± 0.051, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-pharmaceuticals-19-00045"><title>4.5. RT-PCR</title><p>Following surgical excision, samples of gingival tissue were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until RNA extraction was performed. Total RNA was isolated from the tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The process involved phase separation with bromochloropropane, after which the aqueous phase containing RNA was precipitated with isopropanol and washed twice with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was then air-dried and dissolved in nuclease-free water. The concentration and purity of RNA were measured spectrophotometrically at 260/280 nm with an Eppendorf Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). For reverse transcription, iScript Reverse Transcription Mastermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) along with primers specific to target genes (<xref rid="pharmaceuticals-19-00045-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Housekeeping genes included β-actin. PCR amplification was conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA), and relative gene expression levels were calculated via the 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method (Livak &amp; Schmittgen, 2008 [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-19-00045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-pharmaceuticals-19-00045"><title>4.6. Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using standard analytical methods in SPSS software (version 26.0; IBM, New York, NY, USA).

Conclusions</title><p>This study provides further insight into the potential mechanisms underlying amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement. Although inflammatory changes were observed, they appear to represent a secondary or accompanying process rather than the primary cause of this condition. The findings suggest that amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement is likely to represent a multifactorial process in which a fibrotic component may predominate. The increased relative gene expression of α-SMA and IL-13, along with our previous results indicating molecular changes related to extracellular matrix regulation, may indicate the involvement of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation of markers associated with fibroblast differentiation in response to the drug. In addition, the reduced MMP-1 expression observed among amlodipine-treated patients may reflect a possible direct effect of the medication on extracellular matrix turnover, favoring collagen accumulation. Overall, these results suggest that this adverse effect probably results from a complex interplay of enhanced connective tissue deposition, impaired matrix degradation, and secondary inflammation. Nevertheless, additional research with larger samples and further functional assays is needed to confirm these findings and clarify the molecular pathways involved.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study is constrained by a relatively small sample size and reliance on mRNA-based analyses for selected fibrotic markers. Although this methodology offers valuable insight into transcriptional changes associated with gingival enlargement, incorporating protein-level or functional analyses could enhance the interpretation of these results. Future research involving larger patient cohorts and complementary methodological approaches is necessary to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying amlodipine-induced gingival enlargement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

The L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are known to be an important ion channel involved in the various muscle functions and the effect of capsaicin on the skeletal L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is currently unknown. In this study, the effects of capsaicin and capsaicin analogs on depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in transverse tubule membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in rat myotubes were examined. Capsaicin, in the concentration range of 3–100 µM, inhibited depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes. The effect of capsaicin was not reversed by TRPV1 antagonist SB-366791 (10 µM). While vanilloids (30 µM) including vanillin, vanillyl alcohol, and vanillylamine were ineffective, other capsaicinoids (30 µM) including dihydrocapsaicin, nonivamide, and nordihydrocapsaicin significantly inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes, suggesting that hydrocarbon chains are required for inhibition. In rat myotubes, capsaicin inhibited L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 27.2 μM in the presence of SB-366791. Furthermore, in docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations, capsaicinoids with an aliphatic tail showed stronger binding and stable bent conformations in CaV1.1, forming hydrogen bonds with Ser1011 and Thr935 and hydrophobic/π–alkyl contacts with Phe1008, Ile1052, Met1366, and Ala1369, resembling the binding mode of amlodipine. In conclusion, the results indicate that the function of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in mammalian skeletal muscle was inhibited by capsaicin and capsaicin analogs in a TRPV1-independent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>capsaicin</kwd><kwd>T-tubule</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was not supported by any sponsor or funder.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-biomolecules-16-00135"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In skeletal muscle, L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs, CaV1.1) are mainly located in the transverse (T)-tubule system and have dual functions in muscle contractions as voltage sensors and performing channel functions [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CaV1.1 serves primarily as a voltage sensor and translates the excitation to contraction process [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Excitation–contraction coupling in skeletal muscle does not require the channel function of VDCC [<xref rid="B3-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, L-type VDCCs have been suggested to play functional roles in excitation-coupled calcium entry, defined as the entry of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into skeletal muscle during sustained depolarizations or long-lasting tetanic stimulations [<xref rid="B5-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In previous studies, it has been proposed that the entrance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels occurs during tetanic stimulations [<xref rid="B6-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and contributes to the replenishment of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, and provides support to maintain muscle performance during prolonged contractions [<xref rid="B10-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, using non-conducting CaV1.1 mutants [<xref rid="B8-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and CaV1.1 splice variant models [<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it has been shown that reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through L-type VDCCs significantly affected fiber-type specification [<xref rid="B12-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fatty acid metabolism [<xref rid="B13-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as well as neuromuscular junction formation and clustering patterns of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors during embryonic development [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The naturally occurring alkaloid capsaicin, which is found in chili pepper, is known to be responsible for the hot and strong flavor of this plant. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that capsaicin exerts several pharmacological effects, including analgesia, anti-inflammation, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, and antioxidant actions [<xref rid="B16-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In skeletal muscle, capsaicin has been shown to modulate energy expenditure, muscle fatigue, contractions, and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) is the major receptor mediating most of the pharmacological actions of capsaicin. However, several earlier studies report that capsaicin, in addition to the TRPV1 receptor, modulates the functions of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels [<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At low to mid µM ranges, capsaicin has been reported to indirectly affect functions of various ion channels through TRPV1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases. In addition, at these concentration ranges, capsaicin also directly affects the functions of ligand-gated ion channels [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Na<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref rid="B23-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and transporters involved in cellular excitability and muscle contractions [<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux measurements through skeletal muscle T-tubule membranes have been used in previous studies to examine the functional characteristics of L-type VDCCs [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As T-tubule membranes are arranged as sealed, inside-out vesicles, which do not include intracellular organelles [<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], L-type VDCCs in this preparation can be studied in their native membranes without interference by intracellular events.</p><p>Structurally, capsaicinoids, including those used in this study, belong to a class of compounds known as vanilloids. As shown in <xref rid="biomolecules-16-00135-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, a vanillyl (methylcatechol) head group (A-region) and an aliphatic tail (hydrophobic-C-region) linked by a central amide bond (B-region) primarily constitute the chemical structure of capsaicinoids. In this study we compared the effects of capsaicinoids including dihydrocapsaicin, nonivamide, and nordihydrocapsaicin, as well as vanillin derivatives such as vanillin, vanillyl alcohol, and vanillylamine, on Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes through L-type VDCCs in T-tubule membranes, and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in rat skeletal muscle myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-biomolecules-16-00135"><title>2.

Preparation of Transverse Tubule Membranes</title><p>Four-to-six-week-old New Zealand white rabbits (1–1.5 kg) were decapitated, and microsomal membranes were prepared from the hind and back muscles. T-tubules were isolated using sucrose gradient centrifugation following previously described protocols [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. T-tubule membranes were resuspended and equilibrated in low potassium buffer (10 mM HEPES-Tris, pH: 7.4, 145 mM choline chloride, 5 mM potassium gluconate, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>), and kept at −86 °C. Prior to experiments, the vesicles underwent several freeze–thaw cycles to equilibrate intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations [<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-biomolecules-16-00135"><title>2.2. <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> Efflux Assay</title><p>T-tubule membranes (approximately 0.4 mg/mL) were loaded with <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> by adding an equal half volume of isotopically diluted <sup>45</sup>CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution to the same buffer, yielding a final concentration of 5 mM total Ca<sup>2+</sup> containing 50 μCi/mL <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> (PerkinElmer, Springfield, IL, USA). Calcium loading was achieved through two freeze–thaw cycles, after which suspensions were kept on ice and used within 1–2 h. Voltage-dependent <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux was assessed using a two-step filtration assay [<xref rid="B25-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For efflux measurements, 25 μL of loaded membranes were diluted in 975 μL of high-potassium buffer (10 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 120 mM potassium gluconate, 30 mM choline chloride, 0.133 mM EGTA) containing 0.1 μM valinomycin and the appropriate drug where indicated. The initial dilution mimics a cell’s resting state by creating an external (quasi-intracellular) negative membrane potential at −80 mV and lowering free Ca<sup>2+</sup> outside the vesicle (equivalent to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in an inside-out vesicle) to &lt;100 nM. Following a 10 min incubation at room temperature (18–21 °C), 0.9 mL of the suspension was transferred onto a GF/C filter (pre-equilibrated in the same buffer and dried under a vacuum). Excess buffer was removed under vacuum, after which 1 mL of depolarizing buffer (10 mM HEPES-Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM potassium gluconate, 145 mM choline chloride, 0.133 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM valinomycin) was applied. This two-step protocol (F) is referred to as 5-120-5 mM K<sup>+</sup> in the text. Control experiments (C) used dilution buffers at a constant K+ concentration (5-5-5 mM K<sup>+</sup>).

In contrast, vanilloids, compounds lacking the aliphatic tail (vanillin, vanillyl alcohol, vanillylamine) displayed weaker binding scores and less extensive interactions within the pocket. Notably, the presence of the aliphatic tail correlates with functional inhibition in electrophysiology experiments presented in this study, indicating that the tail is essential for activity at the CaV1.1 allosteric site.

RMSD analysis indicated that the receptor backbone remained stable during the 100 ns production runs (RMSD plateau ~2.1 Å), while capsaicinoids and vanilloid compounds exhibited stable accommodation within the pocket (RMSD ~1.5 Å). Clustering analysis identified representative conformations, with the most populated cluster encompassing approximately 80% of simulation frames. These conformations were used for detailed characterization of ligand–receptor interactions.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations show that all capsaicinoids adopt a similar bent conformation within the CaV1.1 allosteric binding pocket.

In this pose, the amide carbonyl oxygen forms a stable hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser1011 (orange), part of the P1 helix, helping to anchor the ligand’s central region.

This bent arrangement enhances van der Waals complementarity and positions the amide linker toward the more polar portion of the site. Overall, the MD-derived pose indicates that the bent conformation—supported by hydrophobic burial of the tail, π–alkyl stacking with Phe1008, stable hydrogen-bonding interactions, and favorable aromatic packing—facilitates tight and persistent binding of capsaicin at the CaV1.1 binding site.</p><p>All three vanilloids (vanillin, vanillyl alcohol, and vanillylamine) adopt similar binding poses and interaction patterns within the CaV1.1 binding pocket. <xref rid="biomolecules-16-00135-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A shows the MD-refined binding pose of vanillyl alcohol, which positions itself between the P1<sub>III</sub> and S6<sub>III</sub> helices.

Notably, capsaicin, at the concentration range used in this study, was shown to affect the function of voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels by altering the elasticity of the bilayer [<xref rid="B49-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and other physicochemical characteristics of cell membranes such as membrane fluidity [<xref rid="B52-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and dipole potential [<xref rid="B54-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, the direct effects of capsaicin might not be solely attributed to modifications in the biophysical properties of the lipid membrane. Through lateral diffusion in the lipid membrane, capsaicin can reach the hydrophobic binding site(s) on the transmembrane domains of ion channels and modulate their functional characteristics. Capsaicin may therefore directly affect the function of ion channels both by binding to hydrophobic amino acids and by modifying the properties of the lipid bilayer.</p><p>The MD-derived poses of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and nonivamide show notable similarity to the binding mode of amlodipine reported for CaV1.1 (skeletal L-type VDCC) in the cryo-EM structure [<xref rid="B32-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In both cases, the ligands occupy the cleft adjacent to the III–IV fenestration, with their aromatic head groups oriented toward the S5–S6 interface and their extended substituents projecting into the hydrophobic cavity. For amlodipine, this role is fulfilled by its aminoethoxymethyl side chain (an elongated, flexible moiety extending from the dihydropyridine core), while for capsaicinoids, the aliphatic chain serves as the primary extended substituent. Capsaicin adopts a bent conformation (<xref rid="biomolecules-16-00135-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,B and <xref rid="biomolecules-16-00135-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B,C) that aligns well with the curved geometry of the dihydropyridine ring and attached side chain of amlodipine, allowing both molecules to follow the contour of the fenestration lumen.</p><p>Residue-level interactions also reveal parallels between capsaicin and amlodipine. Similarly to dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonists, capsaicin forms hydrogen bonds with Ser1011 (P1) and Thr935 (S5), residues known to participate in ligand anchoring within the fenestration. These polar interactions stabilize the ligand at the S5–S6 interface and are complemented by hydrophobic and π–alkyl interactions with neighboring S6 and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-helix residues. The π–alkyl interaction between capsaicin’s aliphatic chain and Phe1008 (P1 helix) resembles the hydrophobic and aromatic contacts formed by the dihydropyridine core of amlodipine. Collectively, the similarity in binding location, ligand shape, and interaction pattern provides a structural rationale for the inhibitory effects of capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and nonivamide on CaV1.1. These compounds appear to occupy a DHP-like binding pose within the fenestration, suggesting that inhibition of L-type channels can arise from a shared set of structural and interaction principles across chemically distinct ligands.</p><p>Additional support comes from the observation that capsaicin contacts many of the same residues as amlodipine, including Ser1011, Thr935, Met1366, Phe1008, Ile1052, and Ala1369. Gao and Yan [<xref rid="B32-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that DHP antagonists stabilize a non-conducting, inactivated conformation of CaV1.1 by forming anchoring interactions across the S5–S6 interface. These interactions constrain S6 movement and limit the conformational transitions required for pore opening. Capsaicin’s analogous hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts may contribute to a similar stabilizing effect: the interaction with Ser1011, located toward the intracellular end of S6, may restrict S6 bending and rotation, while the interaction with Thr935 may help maintain an S5 position that disfavors pore dilation.</p><p>Although capsaicin reproduces many of the key interaction features of DHP antagonists, its affinity is substantially lower than that of amlodipine, which binds in the nanomolar range. This difference suggests that capsaicin engages the CaV1.1 pocket with reduced specificity and may also interact with additional lower-affinity sites elsewhere in the receptor. Vanilloids lacking the aliphatic tail exhibit even weaker interaction patterns, primarily contacting residues on P1<sub>III</sub> and S6<sub>III</sub>. This limited set of interactions is consistent with experimental data showing that vanilloid compounds do not inhibit CaV1.1. Overall, the results of docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that capsaicinoids with an aliphatic tail show stronger binding and stable bent conformations in CaV1.1, forming hydrogen bonds with Ser1011 and Thr935 and hydrophobic/π–alkyl contacts with Phe1008, Ile1052, Met1366, and Ala1369, resembling the binding mode of amlodipine. These interactions support tight receptor engagement and functional inhibition. In contrast, vanilloids lacking the tail displayed weaker binding and limited interactions, consistent with their lack of activity.</p><p>The extrapolation of our findings to clinical applications is not straightforward but may have some implications in mitigating the pathological conditions in which L-type VDCCs play a role. To date, splicing errors or mutations in the CACNA1S, the gene encoding for L-type VDCCs, have been associated with four different kinds of muscle diseases [<xref rid="B1-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These include VDCC (CaV1.1)-related myopathies, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, hypo- and normokalemic periodic paralysis, and myotonic dystrophy type 1 [<xref rid="B55-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Muscle weakness in patients with myotonic dystrophy has been shown to be associated with increased excitation-coupled calcium entry and the abnormal expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeating developmental CaV1.1e splice variant in adult muscle [<xref rid="B56-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], potentially leading to chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload, dysregulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, and mitochondrial damage [<xref rid="B11-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Blockers of L-type VDCCs have been suggested to mitigate both myotonic [<xref rid="B58-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and nonmyotonic dystrophies [<xref rid="B60-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible to speculate that the inhibition of L-type VDCCs by capsaicin-like compounds could be a starting point for investigating novel therapeutic strategies for these conditions, particularly those associated with the gain of function mutations of CaV1.1.</p><p>In recent years, capsaicin has been used as a dietary supplement to reduce appetite and weight gain. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that approximately 50–90% of the ingested capsaicin is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. However, due to rapid and high-level hepatic first-pass metabolism, only a fraction of capsaicin reaches systemic circulation, resulting in low bioavailability and low peak plasma concentrations at sub-µM levels, with a half-time of 30–60 min [<xref rid="B65-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Therefore, a daily intake of capsaicin supplements (1 to 30 mg/day) would not raise blood concentrations to a level that would lead to the significant inhibition of L-type VDCCs observed in this study. However, topical capsaicin application is often employed for analgesia and has been demonstrated to be well-absorbed from skin with a high level of bioavailability [<xref rid="B65-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The concentration of capsaicin in topical preparations ranges from 3 to 260 mM (0.1–8%). Considering that 2% of topical capsaicin is absorbed through the skin [<xref rid="B67-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], dermal concentrations of capsaicin are likely to be between 0.06 and 5.2 mM for topical preparations containing 0.1% and 8% capsaicin, respectively. Notably, due to its highly lipophilic structure, capsaicin concentrations in cell membranes are likely to be significantly higher than in the extracellular compartment. In animal studies, capsaicin concentration in the spinal cord and brain were approximately 5-fold higher than in plasma following intravenous or subcutaneous administration [<xref rid="B66-biomolecules-16-00135" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, the effect of capsaicin on L-type VDCCs observed in this study may be pharmacologically relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-biomolecules-16-00135"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In this study, using electrophysiological and biochemical methods, it was demonstrated that, in the mid µM concentration range, capsaicin and capsaicin analogs, but not vanillin and vanillin derivatives, directly inhibited depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> effluxes in rabbit transverse tubule membranes and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in rat skeletal muscle myotubes in a TRPV1-independent manner. In addition, in docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations, capsaicinoids with an aliphatic tail showed stronger binding and stable bent conformations in CaV1.1, forming hydrogen bonds with Ser1011 and Thr935 and hydrophobic/π–alkyl contacts with Phe1008, Ile1052, Met1366, and Ala1369, resembling the binding mode of amlodipine. In conclusion, these findings suggest that capsaicin directly inhibits the function of L-type VDCCs in mammalian skeletal muscles in a TRPV1-independent manner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors cordially thank the late Susan Dunn of the University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada for her generous supply and initial biochemical characterization of rabbit transverse tubule membranes.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note:</bold> The statements, opinions and data contained in all publications are solely those of the individual author(s) and contributor(s) and not of MDPI and/or the editor(s).

The clinical utility of pharmacogenomics (PGx) in this high-risk population has not been well established. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of PGx-guided precision therapy on blood pressure control, medication optimization, and treatment safety in CKD patients with RH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A single-center prospective cohort study was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">Yidu Cloud</italic> big data platform at People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Sixty-five patients with CKD and RH were enrolled and randomized into either an empirical treatment group (Empirical group, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 22) or a PGx-guided group (PGx group, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 43). Patients in the PGx group received individualized therapy based on genetic testing covering 21 antihypertensive drugs, whereas the Empirical group received conventional empirical treatment. The primary endpoint was the rate of achieving target blood pressure (systolic BP &lt;140 mm Hg, diastolic BP &lt;90 mm Hg) at 24 months. Secondary endpoints included medication optimization, incidence of adverse events, and changes in kidney function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The PGx group demonstrated earlier and greater improvement in blood pressure control compared with the Empirical group. At 0.5 months, the proportion of patients achieving systolic BP targets was significantly higher in the PGx group (20.93% vs. 0%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.021). By 3 months, the diastolic BP target achievement rate had markedly increased (72.09% vs. 27.27%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001) and was sustained through 24 months (systolic BP target rate 44.18% vs. 13.63%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.014). Medication optimization analysis showed a 46.5% reduction in the proportion of patients requiring four to 5 antihypertensive agents in the PGx group, compared with 31.8% in the Empirical group, alongside a 41% lower risk of adverse events (34.88% vs. 59.09%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.016). Genotyping revealed high responsiveness to angiotensin II receptor blockers (candesartan 86.05%, telmisartan 79.07%, irbesartan 76.74%) and calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nitrendipine, and felodipine all 81.40%), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors showed generally poor efficacy. Moreover, the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate at 24 months was significantly less pronounced in the PGx group compared with the Empirical group (8.82% vs. 30.00%, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating a potential renal-protective effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PGx-guided precision therapy enables more rapid and sustained blood pressure control, reduces polypharmacy and adverse events, and slows kidney function decline in CKD patients with RH. This study represents the first PGx-based clinical trial in a multi-ethnic population from Northwest China, providing valuable evidence to support personalized treatment strategies for CKD with RH in East Asian populations.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chronic kidney disease</kwd><kwd>Resistant hypertension</kwd><kwd>Pharmacogenomics</kwd><kwd>Adverse events</kwd><kwd>Precision therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an in-hospital research grant from People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region titled “Preliminary Clinical Study on Precision Therapy for Chronic Kidney Disease Complicated with Resistant Hypertension Guided by Genomics” (Grant No. 20220226) and the “Tianshan Yingcai” High-level Leading Talents Training Program of the Health Commission, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

As a critical risk factor for both cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], RH imposes a substantial global health burden. Epidemiological data indicate that approximately 45% of adults have hypertension, yet only half achieve adequate control [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Patients with RH have nearly a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular events and a 25% greater risk of kidney failure than those with controlled hypertension [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], underscoring the urgent need for more effective management strategies.</p><p>CKD is defined by a sustained reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for more than 3 months or by structural and/or functional kidney abnormalities [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The interplay between CKD and RH creates a vicious cycle: nephron loss leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sodium retention, which in turn drive further blood pressure elevation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Persistent hypertension exacerbates intraglomerular pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation, accelerating renal damage. The prevalence of RH among CKD patients is estimated to be 2–3 times higher than that in the general population [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], particularly in CKD stages 3–5 [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, CKD patients with RH exhibit a 25% higher risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease, heart failure, or death compared with those achieving target blood pressure [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hypertension prevalence also rises in parallel with CKD severity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; approximately 84% of stage 4–5 CKD patients have hypertension [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although international guidelines recommend aggressive blood pressure control to improve CKD prognosis [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], traditional treatment strategies remain limited by high disease prevalence, low target achievement rates, and interindividual differences in drug response.</p><p>Current first-line antihypertensive therapies include angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and diuretics [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of these agents vary widely among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism, transport, and receptor sensitivity [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, CYP2C9 variants reduce the metabolic activity of losartan, diminishing its antihypertensive effect [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while individuals with the AGTR1 (1166A&gt;C) AC/CC genotype exhibit a superior response to irbesartan compared with those carrying the AA genotype [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) provides a molecular foundation for precision medicine by analyzing variations in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP3A5), transporters (e.g., ABCB1), and receptors (e.g., ADRB1) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite growing evidence in Western populations, PGx data for antihypertensive response remain scarce among multi-ethnic Asian populations, particularly in Northwest China, where Han and Uyghur groups coexist. This knowledge gap limits the clinical translation of precision medicine approaches in the region.</p><p>Leveraging the <italic toggle="yes">Yidu Cloud</italic> big data platform of the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, this study represents the first prospective cohort investigation of PGx-guided antihypertensive therapy in multi-ethnic populations from Northwest China. The objectives were to (1) establish a preliminary genetic sensitivity profile of antihypertensive drugs in CKD patients with RH; (2) evaluate the effects of PGx-guided therapy on blood pressure control, medication optimization, and renal function preservation; and (3) provide evidence for developing region-specific precision antihypertensive strategies tailored to East Asian populations. By integrating genotyping for 21 antihypertensive agents with longitudinal clinical follow-up, this study aimed to overcome the limitations of empirical treatment and advance the implementation of precision nephrology in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Population</title><p>This single-center prospective cohort study was conducted using the <italic toggle="yes">Yidu Cloud</italic> big data platform at the People’s Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.

Additionally, diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide were classified as observational or adjusted medications in 76.74% of patients, suggesting that routine use or combination with other agents should be approached cautiously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Kidney Function Changes in the Two Groups</title><p>At baseline, kidney function indicators did not differ significantly between the PGx and Empirical groups (eGFR: 68 vs. 50 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.091; serum creatinine: 99 vs. 123 μmol/L, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.095) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Over the 24-month follow-up, the PGx group demonstrated a markedly superior kidney protection effect compared to the Empirical group (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The eGFR decline rate in the PGx group was only 8.82% (68 vs. 62 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.013), whereas in the Empirical group, it was 30.00% (50 vs. 35 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating that CKD progression in the Empirical group was 3.4 times faster than in the PGx group (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a).</p><p>Changes in serum creatinine further supported these findings.

These results suggest that PGx-guided therapy can effectively delay the deterioration of kidney function in CKD patients with RH.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The pathophysiological interplay between CKD and RH forms a self-perpetuating vicious cycle. In CKD patients, nephron loss, sodium retention, and excessive activation of the RAAS contribute to sustained hypertension, while persistently elevated blood pressure further damages residual nephrons through intraglomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, and oxidative stress, thereby accelerating renal function decline [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although active blood pressure reduction has been demonstrated to slow CKD progression and lower cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], conventional antihypertensive treatment strategies are often limited by delayed therapeutic effects, increased adverse events, and reduced patient compliance, largely due to high interindividual variability in drug response.</p><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple gene loci that provide insights into drug-gene interactions relevant to hypertension management [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. PGx leverages these genetic signals to predict individual responses to specific medications, enabling clinicians to select the most appropriate drugs and dosages for each patient [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Consistent with this rationale, the present study demonstrated that PGx-guided precision therapy in CKD patients with RH confers multiple clinical benefits, including rapid and early achievement of target blood pressure, optimization and reduction of polypharmacy, and significant delay in the deterioration of kidney function. These findings highlight PGx-guided therapy as a promising strategy to interrupt the CKD-RH vicious cycle, offering a more personalized and effective approach to managing high-risk patients.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with and extend the results of the CKD-PGX Study [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which included 335 CKD patients with hypertension and reported that 58% of uncontrolled cases had actionable drug-gene interactions, with PGx-guided therapy reducing 1-year SBP by 4.0 mm Hg and guiding 36% of regimen adjustments. In contrast, our study focused specifically on CKD patients with RH and demonstrated more pronounced benefits: the PGx group achieved a 24-month SBP target rate of 44.18% and a serum creatinine increase of only 6.06%, compared to 43.09% in the Empirical group. These effects were supported by prioritizing RH- and CKD-suitable drugs, with 86.05% sensitivity for candesartan and 81.40% for amlodipine. The underlying mechanism involves identifying gene variations associated with blood pressure regulation, such as AGTR1 1166A&gt;C and CYP2C93, to guide the selection of optimal drug combinations and dosages for each patient [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This aligns with the findings of Wang et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], who demonstrated that PGx-guided therapy mitigates renal injury in hypertensive patients and improves kidney function-related markers.</p><p>The core advantage of PGx lies in its ability to analyze how gene polymorphisms influence both drug metabolism and pharmacodynamic targets. ARB drugs lower blood pressure by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1R), and variants such as AGTR1 1166A&gt;C (rs5186) and CYP2C93 (rs1057910) significantly modulate their efficacy. Patients with A/C or C/C genotypes exhibit enhanced antihypertensive responses to valsartan and irbesartan compared with A/A genotypes [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In our cohort, candesartan, valsartan, and irbesartan were effective in 86.05%, 72.09%, and 76.74% of patients, respectively, reflecting the enhanced AT1R blockade conferred by AGTR1 1166A&gt;C polymorphism, while CYP2C93 genotypes further influenced ARB pharmacokinetics [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Among CCBs, amlodipine, nitrendipine, and felodipine were effective in 81.4% of patients, likely due to CYP3A5 loss-of-function variants enhancing metabolic stability [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This gene-based approach supports the avoidance of adverse events and facilitates rational drug selection.</p><p>Although the median number of medications did not differ statistically between groups, the PGx-guided strategy achieved a “precision simplification” of therapy. Core drugs such as candesartan, telmisartan, and irbesartan showed high routine medication sensitivity (86.05%, 79.07%, 76.74%), whereas losartan required cautious use (routine sensitivity 53.49%, observational 39.53%). ACE inhibitors, including benazepril and enalapril, had routine medication rates below 18% due to ACE I/D polymorphism effects, and nifedipine among CCBs showed only 34.88% routine medication, underscoring the need for individualized assessment. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide (23.26%) and furosemide (37.21%) were limited due to ADD1-associated risks. This precision-guided approach reduced the proportion of patients on 4–5 drug combinations by 46.5% and improved safety by avoiding drug-drug interactions, such as telmisartan-metformin-induced glycemic fluctuations, which is particularly relevant in the 24.61% of participants with diabetes [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, the PGx group demonstrated significant renal protection: the 24-month eGFR decline rate was only 8.82%, 3.4 times lower than the 30.0% observed in the Empirical group, and serum creatinine increase was only 6.06%, approximately one-seventh of that in the Empirical group. Potential mechanisms include precise intrarenal AT1R blockade by ARBs, reducing intraglomerular pressure, hyperperfusion, hyperfiltration, and proteinuria, thereby slowing nephron damage and fibrosis progression [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; selection of metabolically stable CCBs to maintain renal perfusion; and limiting diuretic use (adjusted in 72.09% of patients) to avoid hypokalemia and volume imbalance. Collectively, these findings provide molecular-level evidence supporting a “blood pressure control-kidney protection” collaborative strategy in high-risk CKD + RH populations.</p><p>In terms of safety, the PGx group demonstrated a 41% reduction in overall adverse event risk compared to the Empirical group (34.88% vs. 59.09%), with no severe cardiovascular events or deaths reported. This safety advantage is largely attributable to pharmacogenomic guidance, which enables the avoidance of high-risk medications. For instance, reducing the dose of metoprolol in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers minimizes the risk of bradycardia, while preferential use of felodipine over nifedipine in GNB3 C825T carriers lowers the incidence of peripheral edema. Similarly, avoiding hydrochlorothiazide in patients with ADD1 mutations decreases the likelihood of electrolyte disturbances. Additionally, the PGx group employed a “precision simplification strategy,” significantly reducing polypharmacy; at 24 months, only 46.5% of patients in the PGx group required three or more drugs compared to 68.2% in the Empirical group. This approach allowed for safer, more streamlined treatment regimens, particularly important for complex cases such as patients with concomitant diabetes.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, and the control group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 22) may have been insufficient to detect the effects of rare genotypes, such as CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. Regional factors, including lower initial acceptance of genetic testing and higher patient mobility, contributed to greater exclusions and loss to follow-up in the control arm. Second, potential interactions between environmental factors – such as dietary sodium intake and physical activity – and genetic profiles were not evaluated. Future studies incorporating these variables are needed to develop comprehensive “gene-environment” predictive models for optimizing treatment outcomes in this complex patient population. Finally, the 24-month follow-up period is relatively short for assessing long-term prognosis. Future research should consider multi-center cohort designs with extended follow-up to validate and generalize these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to construct a comprehensive gene sensitivity profile of antihypertensive drugs in CKD patients with RH within multi-ethnic populations in Northwest China. The findings demonstrate that PGx-guided therapy can effectively optimize blood pressure control, minimize adverse events, and slow the progression of kidney function decline. With broader implementation of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines and continued reductions in the cost of genetic testing, PGx-guided therapy is poised to become a routine component of care for high-risk CKD patients, offering a precise, individualized approach to reduce the incidence of end-stage kidney disease and cardiovascular complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="acknowledgments" id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We sincerely thank all the patients and their families who participated in this study.

This study designed a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-formulations, single-dose, three-cycle, three-sequence, partially repeated crossover controlled trial design. A total of 72 healthy Chinese volunteers participated in the fasting and fed trials, of whom 69 completed the trial process. This study employed a methodologically validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine the concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine in plasma. Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 7.0) was used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using a non-compartmental model. Equivalence analysis was performed using the average bioequivalence (ABE) method and the reference-scaled average bioequivalence (RSABE) method. The trial results showed that the test drug was bioequivalent to the reference drug, and no suspected serious adverse reactions or serious adverse events occurred throughout the trial. The results of this study support the launch of the new generic Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablet(I) in China. As a representative antihypertensive fixed-dose combination (FDC), these methodological insights can be directly applied to clinical trials of similar drug products, thereby enhancing success rates while mitigating development risks.</p><p id="Par2"><bold>Clinical trial registration</bold>: CTR20221889, (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/clinicaltrials.searchlist.dhtml.28/07/2022">http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/clinicaltrials.searchlist.dhtml.28/07/2022</ext-link>)</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablet(I)</kwd><kwd>Hypertension</kwd><kwd>Bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>Pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Diseases</kwd><kwd>Drug discovery</kwd><kwd>Medical research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Henan Province Medical Science and Technology Tackling Program Joint Co-Construction Project</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. LHGJ20221004</award-id><award-id>No. LHGJ20221004</award-id><award-id>No. LHGJ20221004</award-id><award-id>No. LHGJ20221004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zuo</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Tiandong</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Bu</surname><given-names>Ziyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© Springer Nature Limited 2026</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3"> China is currently facing the dual pressures of an aging population and the prevalence of metabolic risk factors. The incidence and mortality rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) continue to rise, making it the leading cause of death among the Chinese population. A meta-analysis examined the trends in hypertension prevalence in China from 1959 to 2018, incorporating 18 studies involving over nine million Chinese hypertension patients. The results showed that the annual growth rate of hypertension prevalence in China was 0.29% prior to 2004, and after 2004, it increased to 2.45%, approximately eight times the annual growth rate prior to 2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Unlike secondary hypertension, which has a clear cause, the pathogenesis of primary hypertension remains unclear. It is a complex multifactorial disease involving both neurological and humoral factors, influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The causes and pathogenesis vary among individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The fundamental goal of hypertension treatment is to reduce the overall risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, and vascular complications and mortality. The primary benefit of treatment stems from the reduction in blood pressure itself. The main drugs used clinically to treat hypertension are calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, and beta-blockers, as well as fixed-dose combination formulations composed of these drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Amlodipine, adihydropyridine CCB used to treat hypertension, reaches itspeak concentration between 6 and 8 h after oral dosing. Amlodipine is mostly absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine. Valsartan, an ARB with selectivity for the type 1 receptor subtype, is predominantly eliminated via biliary excretion Maximal plasma concentrations occur 2–4 h after oral administration, and only approximately 20% of valsartan is metabolized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Exforge<sup>®</sup> is a combination tablet developed by Novartis in Switzerland that contains valsartan and amlodipine. Exforge<sup>®</sup> was launched in the European Union in January 2007, in Switzerland in February of the same year, and in the United States in June. On July 23, 2008, it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a first-line treatment for hypertension. In 2009, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) approved the import and marketing of Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablet(I) (trade name: Exforge<sup>®</sup>) developed by Novartis of Switzerland. The approved dosage is 80/5 mg, for use in patients with primary hypertension whose blood pressure cannot be adequately controlled with monotherapy. The efficacy and safety of Exforge<sup>®</sup> are widely recognized by clinicians and patients. In order to alleviate the financial burden on patients with hypertension, provide additional therapeutic options, and improve their quality of life, Hubei Wushi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has developed a new generic tablet containing valsartan and amlodipine (80/5 mg). In adherence to the “Opinions of The General Office of the State Council on the Consistency Evaluation of the Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs” (No. 106, 2016) set by NMPA, it is necessary to conduct bioequivalence (BE) studies to ensure the consistency of our generic drug with the brand drug (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2016-03/05/content_5049364.htm">https://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2016-03/05/content_5049364.htm</ext-link>, Last access data 30 Jul, 2025).</p><p id="Par5">According to the Catalog of Generic Reference Preparations (Batch 10, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/xxgk/ggtg/ypggtg/ypqtggtg/20171013175801889.html">https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/xxgk/ggtg/ypggtg/ypqtggtg/20171013175801889.html</ext-link>, Last access data 30 Jul, 2025), Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablet(I) (trade name: Exforge<sup>®</sup>, 80/5 mg) manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceutica S.A. were selected as reference product. In this study, blood samples were collected from healthy Chinese volunteers under fasting and fed conditions after administration of the test and reference drugs. The concentrations of valsartan and amlodipine in plasma were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated to evaluate whether the generic drug exhibited bioequivalence (BE) to the branded product. Additionally, the safety profiles of both the test and reference drugs were assessed in healthy volunteers.</p><p id="Par6">Valsartan is considered a highly variable drug (HVD) because only approximately 20% is recovered as a metabolite, and cytochrome P450 isozymes are known to contribute little to its metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, valsartan was revealed to be a HVD, as the CV% of the C<sub>max</sub> is &gt; 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As a representative antihypertensive FDC, the BE study of valsartan-amlodipine tablets not only provides evidence for the market authorization of its generic versions but also offers critical reference for clinical trial design, methodological optimization, and regulatory strategies for other drugs—particularly FDCs and highly variable drugs (HVDs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par7">This study enrolled 72 healthy Chinese volunteers (36 fasting and 36 fed), comprising both male and female participants aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) with balanced gender distribution.

The study protocol and amendments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Xinxiang Central Hospital (Approval Nos. 2021-039, 2022 − 249, and 2022 − 537). Registration for this study was completed on the “Drug Clinical Trial Registration and Information Disclosure Platform” (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/clinicaltrials.searchlist.dhtml,28/07/2022,CTR20221889">http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/clinicaltrials.searchlist.dhtml,28/07/2022,CTR20221889</ext-link>). Throughout the study, all procedures were strictly performed in compliance with the ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects as outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines issued by NMPA, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, and relevant domestic laws and regulations.</p><p id="Par12">According to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, valsartan exhibited substantial intra-subject variability, with intra-subject coefficients of variation (CV) for AUC<sub>0 − t</sub>, AUC<sub>0−∞</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> being 30.0%, 27.6%, and 31.2%, respectively, classifying it as a highly variable drug. In contrast, amlodipine demonstrated relatively low intra-subject variability. Therefore, the sample size estimation for this study was based on the intra-subject variability of valsartan. The sample size was calculated using the intra-subject CV of C<sub>max</sub> (three-way crossover, table look-up method). Taking into account the potential influence of food on drug absorption as well as the anticipated dropout rate, it was determined that 36 healthy volunteers would be enrolled for both the fasting and fed trials. To assess the BE of HVDs, which have relatively short elimination half-lives, a replicate crossover design with three or four periods would be appropriate. Under the same conditions, a four-period replicate crossover design requires fewer participants than a three-period replicate crossover design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Since it is considered ethical for healthy participants to participate in a short duration and low exposure to drugs, the probability of losing participants increases as the study duration becomes longer.We performed a 3-period reference replicate crossover study with 36 subjects. Statistically, the replication of administration within a subject improves the quality of the data and leads to definitive study results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">The study was designed as a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-formulation, single-dose, three-period, three-sequence, partially replicated crossover bioequivalence trial conducted under fasting and fed conditions in accordance with relevant guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Volunteers were assigned screening numbers in chronological order of screening. On Day − 1 of the trial, each eligible volunteer received a randomization number generated by the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (version 9.4) using 1:1:1 block randomization, arranged from the smallest to largest screening number. The randomization number served as the administration sequence number, with 12 subjects allocated to each group. This study was an open-label study.

Approximately 4 mL of venous blood was drawn from the upper limb and collected in EDTA-K<sub>2</sub> (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid Dipotassium Salt) anticoagulant vacuum tubes. To ensure sample stability, the blood collection tube should be gently inverted six times to thoroughly mix with the anticoagulant. The sample was then placed under yellow light at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged (centrifugation parameters: temperature set at 4 °C, relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 1700 × g, duration 10 min). The plasma was transferred into amber cryovials and stored in a −80 °C freezer. Special attention must be paid to the time interval from blood collection to plasma separation and storage at either − 20 °C or directly at −80 °C, which should be strictly controlled within 100 min (not exceeding 120 min). If temporarily stored at −20 °C, samples must be transferred to a −80 °C freezer within 24 h.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par42">This study evaluated the bioequivalence of two Valsartan-Amlodipine Tablets (I) in healthy Chinese volunteers to support the clinical application of generic formulations. Furthermore, we assessed the PK data between the fasting and fed trials and found that food did not influence the AUC<sub>0–∞</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> values of amlodipine for either the T or R formulations. However, the main PK parameters (C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0–t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0–∞</sub>) of valsartan in the fed condition were significantly decreased compared with that in the fasting condition. We hypothesize that due to structural and solubility differences between amlodipine and valsartan, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the more lipophilic valsartan are susceptible to high-fat dietary effects, whereas amlodipine remains unaffected. Valsartan exhibits poor dissociation and readily absorbs under physiological pH conditions. Typically, food elevates gastric pH and slows gastric emptying rate, leading to increased valsartan dissociation and consequently reduced drug absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, physical or chemical interactions between drugs and food may affect drug absorption following oral administration. Our study demonstrated that the rate and extent of absorption of valsartan were significantly reduced under fed conditions, whereas no such effect was observed for amlodipine. Multiple factors may contribute to this discrepancy, including ethnicity, inter-individual variability, and metabolic enzyme genotypes. Genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzyme genes can alter the metabolic activity toward various clinically important drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, based on current evidence, it remains difficult to infer the specific contributing factors.</p><p id="Par43">In this study, AEs occurring during the trial period were collected and evaluated. All reported AEs were of mild to moderate severity with favorable recovery, and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed. In the fed condition, 17 AE cases were reported, of which 5 cases (2 cases/drug T and 3 cases/drug R) were assessed as possibly drug-related, while the remaining 12 cases were deemed unlikely to be drug-related. In the fasting conditions, 31 AE cases occurred, with 21 cases (9 cases/drug T and 12 cases/drug R) classified as possibly drug-related, 6 cases as definitely drug-unrelated, and 4 cases as unlikely to be drug-related. The incidence of AEs in the fed condition was lower than that in the fasting condition, and the test drug demonstrated a lower AE incidence compared to the reference drug.This outcome may be attributed to the significantly lower C<sub>max</sub> of valsartan after meals compared to fasting conditions, coupled with the test formulation exhibiting a lower C<sub>max</sub> than the reference formulation. These results indicate that the generic drug maintains an acceptable safety profile for Chinese volunteers participating in the study.</p><p id="Par44">Finally, the study data are compared with previously conducted studies in other countries and regions, and these data are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. The C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0 − t</sub> (h·ng/mL) of valsartan under both fed and fasting conditions were similar to previously published data collected from healthy Chinese subjects but slightly lower than those reported in studies involving non-Chinese populations. These discrepancies may be attributed to differences in volunteer cohorts, administered doses, and reagents used across studies. Assuming that the impact of dosage on the trial is limited to simple dose superposition, the C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub> (h), t<sub>1/2</sub>, and AUC<sub>0 − t</sub> of amlodipine under fed and fasting conditions were comparable to previously reported data. This suggests that differences in volunteer populations (e.g., Chinese, American, Korean) have minimal influence on the systemic exposure of amlodipine. These findings further indicate that, compared with amlodipine, valsartan exhibits a higher intrasubject coefficient of variation.</p><p id="Par45">

</p><p id="Par46">Similar to most bioequivalence studies, this study also has certain limitations. First, the study subjects were a small number of healthy young volunteers who met strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Due to disease status, comorbidities, or drug interactions, the pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers may differ from those in actual patients and may not represent a broader population (e.g., patients, elderly individuals, children, or other ethnic groups), thereby limiting clinical relevance. It is necessary to conduct further studies in larger populations, including target patients and elderly individuals. Furthermore, the single-dose design and short-term follow-up cannot assess adverse events (AEs) associated with long-term medication use. Given that the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) comparability between the test drug and the reference drug, long-term administration in healthy volunteers lacks sufficient clinical justification. For further safety assessment, longitudinal follow-up studies should be implemented.</p><p id="Par47">The current results show that valsartan is an highly variable drug (HVD), and that Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablets (I) represents a complex problem in terms of BE assessment. A replicate crossover study can be conducted if an applicant suspects that the absorption rate and/or extent of a drug product are highly variable. The main purpose of our study is to support an increase in the supply of Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablets (I) in China by proving the efficacy and safety of a generic alternative. For bioequivalence evaluation, we used two NMPA-specified methods (ABE and RSABE) in this study which can be used as a reference for the design and implementation of future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par48">The Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablets (I) produced by Hubei Wushi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. were found to have mild adverse reactions and good safety after single-dose oral administration to Chinese healthy volunteers, and were bioequivalent to the reference drug, Exforge<sup>®</sup>. They can be substituted for each other in clinical practice. The results of this study provide support for the market launch of the new generic valsartan/amlodipine tablets in China.</p><p id="Par49">On the other hand, the Valsartan/Amlodipine Tablets (I), as a representative antihypertensive fixed-dose combination (FDC), has established a template for BE studies of other FDCs through its “component-specific differential statistical strategy.” This approach effectively addresses the statistical challenges associated with HVDs. These methodological insights can be directly applied to clinical trials of similar drug products, thereby enhancing success rates while mitigating development risks.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher’s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors sincerely acknowledge the volunteers and staff who participated in this study.

Nevertheless, whether chronic plateau exposure affects antihypertensive efficacy in hypertensive highlanders remains unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>This is a post hoc analysis of the OMAN Trial, a randomized controlled study that compared the antihypertensive efficacy of morning versus bedtime administration of olmesartan/amlodipine. Hypertensive patients from the OMAN Trial were stratified into highlanders (Sichuan-Tibet Plateau, altitude ≈ 3000 m) and lowlanders (Sichuan-Chengdu Plain, altitude ≈ 500 m) based on 1 : 1 propensity score matching.

While office BP reductions were comparable between groups, highlanders showed significantly smaller reductions in 24-h ambulatory BP compared with lowlanders (between-group difference in 24-h SBP reduction: −2.39 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.048; between-group difference in 24-h DBP reduction: –1.60 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.025).

The latest data show that over 80 million people reside in high-altitude regions, predominantly within the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, Alps, and Ethiopian Plateau [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The special plateau environmental factors characterized by hypoxic hypoxia and low temperature, induces pathophysiological changes such as polycythemia, vascular endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic overdrive, and oxidative stress, which synergistically lead to a heavier hypertension disease burden and distinct blood pressure (BP) phenotypes in high-altitude populations [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Epidemiological studies among Tibetan highlanders reveal a 2% increase in hypertension prevalence per 100 m rise in AASL [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, residents at AASL at least 3500 m (classified as very high altitude) exhibit a 27% heightened hypertension risk compared to lower altitude populations [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Although epidemiological studies suggest higher hypertension risk in plateau environments, it remains unclear whether high altitude would affect the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs. A clinical study from Colombia involving 142 hypertensive patients demonstrated comparable reductions in office BP with valsartan 80 mg or enalapril 20 mg across three altitude gradients (2600, 1538, 100 m) during 4-week treatment [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, methodological constraints – including limited sample size, moderate altitude range, reliance on office BP measurements rather than ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), and absence of medication adherence evaluation – precluded definitive conclusions regarding altitude-dependent antihypertensive efficacy. Due to the lack of evidence, current guidelines for hypertension management have not incorporate chronic high-altitude exposure as a therapeutic modifier in antihypertensive regimen optimization [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To address this critical knowledge gap in personalized antihypertensive management for highland populations, we conducted a <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis of a randomized controlled trial (OMAN Trial [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), comparing the antihypertensive efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (olmesartan/amlodipine 20/5 mg once daily) between distinct altitude environments (Sichuan-Tibet Plateau, ~3000 m AASL vs. Sichuan-Chengdu Plain, ~500 m AASL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data will be available upon reasonable request to the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population and design</title><p>The OMAN trial (registration: ChiCTR2200059719) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial to compare the effects of morning vs. bedtime administration of antihypertensive medication on BP reduction and circadian rhythm, which enrolled representative hypertensive patients from the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau (AASL ≈ 3000 m) and Sichuan-Chengdu Plain (AASL ≈ 500 m), respectively. The designs and main results of the OMAN trial have been published previously [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The study protocol was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Review Committee at West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Written informed consent has been obtained from all study participants.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: age at least 18 years and less than 75 years; SBP at least 140 mmHg and/or DBP at least 90 mmHg in three different days; even if BP is less than 140/90 mmHg, yet have a history of hypertension and are taking antihypertensive medications; 24-h ABPM meets any of the following: 24 h mean BP at least 130/80 mmHg, the mean nocturnal BP at least 120/70 mmHg, average daytime BP at least 135/85 mmHg; discontinuing antihypertensive drugs for more than 2 weeks (2 weeks of drug washout) or not receiving antihypertensive treatment; have a regular sleep schedule and schedule activities (not night shift workers); live in the plateau or plain for more than 5 years, and there is no significant cross-altitude travel (&lt;500 m) during the trial.</p><p>The exclusion criteria are as follows: planning pregnancy, pregnant or lactating women; underlying diseases: bilateral renal artery stenosis, chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;265 μmol/l), hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/l); hypertensive emergencies or hypertensive crisis, malignant hypertension; history of angioedema caused by drug-related or other reasons or allergy to ACEIs/ARBs and CCBs; unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, severe arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation; history of drug addiction or alcoholism; work in shifts or night shifts.</p><p>Enrolled patients received olmesartan/amlodipine (20/5 mg once daily) for 4 weeks, with office and ambulatory BP measured at baseline and the end of the 4-week course (Fig. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Unused drugs were recovered posttreatment, and the proportion of days covered (PDC) was calculated to assess the medication adherence. PDC = (dispensed dose − recovered dose)/the amount of tablets to take × 100% [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PDC at least 90% defined good adherence in this study. To clarify the influence of plateau on antihypertensive efficacy, we utilized altitude as the grouping variable and 1 : 1 propensity score to match the baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, smoking, drinking, diabetes, hyperuricemia, ABPM parameters, BP rhythms, and time of taking drugs. All participants live in the original altitude for more than 5 years and have no cross-altitude travel during the trial period. The study outcomes were the difference of BP reduction (including office and ambulatory BP reduction) and the difference of the BP control rate (office and ambulatory) between lowlanders and highlanders. In addition, we also assessed plateau-induced differences in BP rhythms during treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the study design.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="jhype-44-470-g002.jpg"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Definitions</title><sec><title>Definitions of hypertension, hypertension control, and nondipper hypertension</title><p>In this study, hypertension was defined as office SBP at least 140 mmHg or DBP at least 90 mmHg in three different days; or meeting the ABPM criteria for hypertension: 24-h BP at least 130/80 mmHg, mean daytime BP at least 135/85 mmHg, or nocturnal BP at least 120/70 mmHg [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Office BP control was defined as office SBP less than 140 mmHg (office SBP control) and DBP less than 90 mmHg (office DBP control) after 4 weeks of antihypertensive treatment.

Following 4-week treatment with identical drug, dose (olmesartan/amlodipine 20/5 mg once daily), and high adherence (both PDC &gt; 95%), highlanders exhibited significantly smaller ambulatory BP reductions (excluding nocturnal BP) vs. controls, especially in the morning BP (ΔSBP: −7.18 mmHg; ΔDBP: −4.01 mmHg) and the daytime BP (ΔSBP: −3.81 mmHg; ΔDBP: −2.29 mmHg). Similarly, 24-h BP control rates were significantly lower at high altitude (highlanders: 34.5% vs. lowlanders: 50.9%, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.002). Multivariable analysis confirmed plateau altitude as the sole independent predictor of impaired 24-h BP control (OR = 0.525, 95% CI: 0.31–0.88). To our knowledge, this constitutes the first investigation of chronic plateau environmental effects on antihypertensive efficacy of ambulatory BP in highlanders. Our findings suggest chronic high-altitude exposure may weaken the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs, potentially necessitating intensified treatment regimens for BP control in highland populations.</p><p>High-altitude environment is characterized by hypoxic hypoxia and low temperature, which will significantly affect the cardiovascular physiology of exposed individuals. Previous studies have shown that chronic high-altitude exposure promotes vascular endothelial dysfunction, sympathetic overactivation, oxidative stress, and polycythemia, which collectively elevate BP [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that acute/chronic high-altitude exposure can raise BP, and clinical recommendations have been introduced for antihypertensive treatment of acute high-altitude exposure [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, evidence regarding chronic altitude effects on antihypertensive efficacy remains limited. Consequently, current hypertension guidelines do not incorporate chronic high-altitude exposure as a therapeutic modifier [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Botero <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> recruited 142 hypertensive patients (128 completed the study) across three Colombian cities (Bogotá 2600 m, Medellín 1538 m, Barranquilla 100 m) and randomized them to valsartan 80 mg once daily or enalapril 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks, reporting comparable office BP reductions across altitude [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our study advances this field through key methodological distinctions: (i) altitude specificity: targeting altitude about 3000 m with prototypical high-altitude pathophysiology; (ii) sample size: our propensity-matched cohorts (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 171 per group) exceed Botero's subgroup allocations (≈20 per altitude-treatment arm); (iii) objective outcomes: we implemented ABPM rather than single-timepoint office BP measurements to assess the antihypertensive efficacy; (iv) protocol standardization: fixed-dose combination with verified adherence post 2 weeks of drug washout. The ongoing INTERVENCION trial was designed to evaluate the differences in the efficacy of three first-line antihypertensive agents (thiazide diuretics: hydrochlorothiazide, ARBs: telmisartan, and CCBs: amlodipine) at three altitude gradients (&lt;1500, 1500–3000, and &gt;3000 m) in Andean hypertensive patients [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We also look forward to the results of INTERVENCION trial to compare the influence of the Andean and Tibetan plateaus on antihypertensive efficacy, as previous studies have shown differences in adaptive changes in cardiovascular pathophysiology as well as altitude–BP associations between the two representative plateau populations [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Notably, our findings demonstrate a temporal pattern in altitude-dependent antihypertensive efficacy: hypertensive highlanders exhibited attenuated morning and daytime BP reductions while maintaining nocturnal BP reductions and control rates comparable to lowland counterparts. Two environmental mechanisms may explain this diurnal divergence: (i) hypoxia modulation: daytime activity exacerbates oxygen supply-demand imbalance, amplifying pressor effects. Nighttime rest improves oxygen balance, attenuating hypoxia-driven BP elevation; (ii) thermal influence: markedly lower plateau temperatures (Sichuan-Tibet plateau annual mean: 9 °C vs. Sichuan-Chengdu Plain: 18.1 °C) induce peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathetic activation during daytime outdoor activities [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Conversely, nighttime indoor resting minimizes cold exposure effects. The comparable nocturnal BP reductions between groups may partially mitigate the overall 24-h BP reduction differences. Due to the severe cold and logistical challenges of winter, patient enrollment and follow-up were conducted during the second and third quarters, when the average ambient temperature was approximately 10 °C. It is plausible that the low-temperature effect during winter could exert a more pronounced influence on antihypertensive efficacy, a hypothesis that warrants future investigation.</p><p>While the inter-group differences in 24-h BP reduction appeared numerically modest (ΔSBP: −2.39 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.048; ΔDBP: −1.60 mmHg, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.025), the clinically significant disparities in morning and daytime BP reductions, along with lower control rates (Fig. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), may contribute to accumulated cardiovascular risk over time [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consequently, for hypertensive highlanders, our findings underscore the importance of ambulatory BP monitoring – particularly for assessing morning and daytime BP control – and consider treatment intensification to achieve BP targets when necessary. However, whether more intensive therapy confers additional cardiovascular benefits in this population remains to be established in long-term outcome studies.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. (1) Generalizability: (i) Tibetan-specific physiological adaptations may not extend to other high-altitude populations with divergent genetic profiles (e.g.t Andeans); (ii) The fixed-altitude design (~3000 m) precludes extrapolation to other altitude; (iii) exclusion of acute/transient exposures limits applicability to short-term high-altitude exposure scenarios; (2) drug selection: the single-pill ARB/CCB combination (olmesartan/amlodipine) was selected for its sustained antihypertensive efficacy and established utility in mitigating acute altitude-induced BP elevation [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, ARB/CCB combination efficacy doesn’t preclude class-specific or regimen-dependent variations in antihypertensive efficacy; (3) Dietary confounders: sodium intake was not adjusted due to methodological constraints – while 24-h urinary sodium excretion remains the gold standard for salt intake assessment, the therapeutic doses of olmesartan employed in the present study inherently alters urinary sodium excretion, which compromises the validity of sodium consumption estimates derived from urinary parameters. Further studies should clarify dietary influences and compare antihypertensive strategies across diverse altitude gradients; (4) genetic background: the participants from the high-altitude region were predominantly Tibetan, whereas those from the Sichuan-Chengdu Plain were mainly Han Chinese. Although we matched the two groups for baseline metabolic parameters and lifestyle factors, genetic differences may remain a potential confounder. Nevertheless, under Cavalli-Sforza's phylogenetic framework, both groups belong to the East Asian Mongoloid cluster. Furthermore, longstanding cultural integration and intermarriage may have attenuated genetic divergence. Thus, we cautiously infer that ethnic differences likely had minimal confounding effects on the observed outcomes. Future studies comparing populations with more homogeneous genetic backgrounds across different altitudes are needed.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that chronic plateau exposure may attenuate antihypertensive drug efficacy in hypertensive highlanders, potentially necessitating intensified treatment regimens compared to lowland populations to achieve BP control.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Huizhen Liu (from Center of Biostatistics, Design, Measurement and Evaluation (CBDME), Ministry of Science and Technology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China) for her statistical guidance.</p><p>Sources of funding: this work was supported by the Science and Technology Program of Tibet Autonomous Region (Grant number: XZ202303ZY0004G).</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jhype-44-470-s001.docx" id="d67e1265" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD2" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="jhype-44-470-s002.docx" id="d67e1271" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>X.Z. and X.Z. equally contributed to the article.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AASl, altitude above sea level; ABPM, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; ARBs, angiotensin II receptor blockers; BP, blood pressure; CCBs, calcium channel blockers; PDC, proportion of days covered; SMD, standardized mean difference</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental digital content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>KT</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Stefanescu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>He</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>The global epidemiology of hypertension</article-title>. <source><italic toggle="yes">Nat Rev Nephrol</italic></source>
